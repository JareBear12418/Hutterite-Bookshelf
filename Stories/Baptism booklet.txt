***********

Does the Lord Jesus think of us also in Heaven?

***********

What is the Holy Spirit?
A godly power, an eternal, incomprehensible and invisible being, which
with the Father and the Son from the beginning and from eternity has been
one, and will also remain one forever; which Holy Spirit formerly has
spoken through the holy prophets, and in these last times, according to the
promise and petition of Christ and goes out from the Father and the Son,

and teaches, enlightens, comforts, strengthens and also sanctifies those
predestined to life. (Joh. 1:1, 15:26, 16:13)
***********

How does one participate in the Holy Spirit and His
workings?
Through faith and godly obedience.
***********

What is faith?
Faith is a certain confidence in God’s promises, when one holds for certain
and true what God’s Word says and promises, especially of our Savior, the
Lord Jesus Christ, of His promises and incarnation, and of the grace He
has won and the eternal life which He has gained for us and given to us
through His death and the shedding of His blood. (Heb. 11:1)
***********

What is godly obedience?
When one puts his own will in God’s will, and after one knows God’s will,
endeavors from the heart to walk according to God’s will.
***********

How is one confirmed and assured in the faith?
Through the Word of God and through the Holy Spirit, when one receives
baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness and remission of
sin.
***********

What is baptism?
Baptism is an outward work, ordained and commanded by the Lord Jesus
Himself, and transpires with the pouring on of water in the name of the
Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
***********

What does water baptism teach and mean?
It teaches and means that the old Adam in us through daily remorse and
repentance shall be drowned, die and be buried, and that on the contrary
shall rise again and come forth a new man, who shall live in righteousness
and holiness in the presence of God forever.
***********

What is the old Adam?
All sinful and wicked desires and vices, which are born in us, which can
also be reckoned to original sin.
***********

How shall the old Adam in us be drowned, killed and buried?
Through daily remorse and repentance and abstinence from all sins and
wicked desires, that one not let wickedness rule and break out any more.
***********

What is the 'new man'?
Nothing other than the accomplishing of the will of God, and the new
godly obedience, which the Holy Spirit works in us, when He continually
moves our hearts and minds from bad to good, and leads us in all truth.

***********

How is such to be proven?
Paul says to the Romans (in the sixth chapter): “Therefore we are buried
with Him by baptism into death; so that as Christ was raised up from the
dead by the glory of the Father, even also might we walk in newness of
life.'
***********

What does the apostle mean with these words?
He means that just as Christ died and was buried physically, so also should
we kill and bury spiritually wicked temptations and sinful lusts in us; that
is, overcome them, that they no more break out and rule over us. And as
Christ was bodily resurrected from the dead, and dies no more, thus the
Apostle wills that we should also, through the help and through the
assistance of the Holy Spirit, enter into a heavenly life, and continue
steadfastly therein until the end.
***********

Can one also fall away again from goodness and from the
grace of God?
Yes indeed! It one does not walk in constant fear and holy attention, then
one can quite easily fall away from grace. Therefore let anyone who thinks
that he stands, says Paul, take heed lest he fall. (1 Cor. 10:12)
***********

Then, what happens to such people, who fall away and cast
off God's grace?

Because they hurt and provoke the Holy Spirit of God with their sin, He
departs from them and gives them over to the lusts of their hearts, which
are of no value.
***********

Do such as have subsequently angered God with their sins
and despise His grace have hereafter no hope of salvation?
No! For as long as they persist in sin, nothing else is promised them but
the displeasure of God, tribulation and fear, and an expectation of a
terrible judgment. But if they repent, however, are sorry for their sins and
convert, then God is true and lets them in His name be shown peace and
forgiveness of sins.
***********

Through whom does God let His peace and forgiveness of
sins be proclaimed and given?
Through His teachers and ministers, who are stewards and emissaries of
Christ.
***********

From whom do the teachers and ministers have the power to
proclaim peace and forgiveness of sins?
From the Lord Jesus Himself. For He gave them two keys: one to loosen,
the other to bind. “And He breathed on them and said to them, ‘Receive
the Holy Spirit. If ye forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you
retain the sins of any, they are retained.’'
***********

What is the key to bind?

Nothing other than the ban, with which the unrepentant sinner is put out
from the community, in order that they may thereby be led to repentance
and may come to the grace of God again.
***********

What is the key to loosen?
It is the power of the ministers of Christ, through which they remit the sins
of the repentant sinner in the name of the Father, of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit, and accept them again into the communion of saints.
***********

What is the communion of saints?
The communion of saints is firstly: nothing else than the new
covenant of grace in Christ; for all who accept Christ through faith and
follow Him may expect the same wages and the same salvation, through
His name and what He has earned for us. For no more is there Greek, nor
Jew, or circumcision: but over all and in all Christ. He the Head and we
His believers, His members; we in Him and He in us. He in the Father and
the Father in Him.
And secondly, that too is the communion of saints, when the
believers serve one another with surrendered hearts; none says of his
goods, that they are his, but “they held all things common; and they sold
their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, as any had need.'
(Acts 2:44-45)
And thus whosoever truly lives in such a communion of saints here
in this time and also remains true and persists to the end, he will also in
that time be found in that communion of saints in the time to come; then
Christ will say, (Mt. 25:34) “Come, O blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.'
***********

What happens to a man when he has died and been buried in
the earth?
The dead body, which is buried in the earth, decomposes, and
becomes again dust and earth, for, as God said to Adam: (Gen. 3:19) “You
are dust and to dust you shall return.'
The soul, however, which lives in the man’s body, is immortal and eternal;
and if its house, that is, its body, breaks down and dies, then God takes it to
Himself again, and will give it a new and transfigured body, which will be
like unto the angels, and will see and enjoy all the glory obtained through
the Lord Christ.
But how, and at what time such will take place, God has hidden from
us, and has retained it only in His omniscience and power. And it is also
unnecessary to want to know it, or to write about it, for we believers have
in the words of our Savior Jesus Christ enough, when He promises us with
His truthful mouth that we will not see death eternally, and that we will
never more die. Yes, although we die according to the natural body,
nevertheless we shall live. And that we, after casting aside this mortal
body, shall sit in Heaven with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; we shall be like
the angels of God in Heaven; yes, that we shall be where He is. “And when
I go to prepare a place for you,' says the Lord Jesus. “I will come again,
and will take you to myself; that where I am you may be also.' (John 14:3)
And as He also asks in His high priestly prayer to His heavenly
Father, saying: “Father, I will that they also, whom Thou hast given me,
may be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which Thou
hast given me: for Thou lovest me before the foundation of the world.'
(John 17:24)
And thus the passing away of the pious and believing is not death,
but a change from the temporal into the eternal life. For he is “passed from
death to life' says the Lord Jesus Christ. (John 5:24)
The grace of God our Lord Jesus Christ,
And the love of God the Father,
And the communion of the Holy Spirit,
Be with you and with us all. Amen.

Warning (1 Peter 3:21)
Baptism is not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of
a good conscience toward God. The water makes no one into a Christian.
Baptism or the water does not take away the sinful nature of our flesh;
rather the content of baptism and the covenant is this: that we henceforth
strive and fight against our sinful nature, and not let it rule or break out
into our mortal body. But live a godly life in this world. Indeed, it means
that whoever has accepted true Christian baptism is henceforth obligated
at all times to live with a good conscience, and to keep himself, that he be
of a pure heart. For a pure, good heart, says the scripture, is a perpetual
feast. There must be a resurrection to a new life; our old man must be
crucified, and in Christ a new one must arise, which is created in the
image of God, in righteousness and holiness. Amen.

Baptism poem
1. Oh Lord, my God, I pray for grace
Ere Judgment Day I have to face!
Through Christ, our Lord, oh, may I be
Of inborn sinfulness set free
And learn to follow Thy command.

Which Eve and Adam did withstand.
So let me deeply ponder all
That troubles men through Adam’s fall.
2. This hurt has plagued with many fears
All travelers through this vale of tears.
We cannot act the way we should.
For sin prevents our doing good.
Conceived and born in sin’s dread might,
We have no strength to do the right.
Our heart is set on evil ways
From youth and on through all our days.
3. Since Adam, life with death is fraught,
And lasting death had been our lot
If God the Lord had not stepped in
To free us from the bonds of sin.
So moved was God by men’s distress
That He in mercy measureless
Resolved, that sin might be undone,
To send His own beloved Son
With Devil and with Death to strive
And lead us through to lasting life.
4. God–Father, Son, with Spirit bright
Did then set out to end our plight.
His angel Gabriel sent He
To Nazareth in Galilee.
A maiden chaste the angel sought
And wondrous tidings to her brought,
Telling that she would bear as child
The Son of God, pure, undefiled,
That our Redeemer He would be,
Would ransom us from slavery
And sweep away the evils all
That plague our race since Adam’s fall.

5. Now let me tell you of God’s plan
And how this child became a man,
Who by great words and deeds of might
Did people to himself invite
And told them that with one accord
Their lives should magnify the Lord.
Above all, love they were to prize
For by it men should recognize
Who are true members of His band,
Since faith and love go hand in hand.
6. In Scripture it is clearly shown:
A gift is faith, from God alone.
Therefore we ask the Holy Ghost.
To grant us true faith uppermost,
And that we sinners rise from death
In watery grave by Spirit’s breath.
For Christ himself the water is,
And washed by Him, we then are His.
7. Yet now mark well how all around
A worldly baptism is found,
Where men still follow their own will,
God’s clear commands do not fulfill,
And yet expect their due reward.
But Scripture warns of what the Lord
Will say to every man who still
Would disobey God’s holy will.
8. This, my dear child, you ought to know:
To do good deeds be never slow;
Trust only in your God and King
And in your Savior’s suffering,
Who for our sin paid all the price–
An everlasting sacrifice.
In firm faith you must hold to this
And let your grateful heart be His.

9. For God so loved us men that He
Gave His own Son to set us free.
He came to earth our sins to bear
And now invites all men to share
The peace and joy that He bestows
On all who follow where He goes.
You too, dear child, a follower be
And guard your lips from blasphemy.
10. In Holy Scripture we are told
That Jesus Christ we shall behold,
With all His angel hosts appear
In power and glory drawing near.
From Heaven to earth He’ll come and stay
To usher in the Judgment Day.
How great a gathering that will be
When all mankind their Judge will see!
11. All men and peoples everywhere
Their Judge to face must then prepare.
What counts is all our deeds on earth–
We shall receive what they were worth.
Christ will tell each where he should stand,
Will place His sheep at His right hand,
While to His left the goats are led.
Then He will pass the sentence dread.
12. To those assembled on His right
He will say, “Children of the light,
Possess now in eternity
My Father’s Kingdom joyfully.'
Then He will stretch His hand out high
And with stern judgment terrify
The wicked ones on His left hand:
“You shall be doomed, accursed band,
In eternal torment there to dwell

With Satan and his host of hell!'
13. And all lost souls in their distress,
Who did but scoff at holiness,
Shall see in sunlike radiance
The just gaze on God’s countenance,
Whereas for them who lived in sin
Unending woe and grief begin.
14. Of this, dear child, do not lose sight:
No one can describe aright
The awful burden and despair
Ungodly souls will have to bear.
From every sin this should deter:
It should to deeds of kindness stir
And make you seek that precious hoard–
A conscience pure before the Lord.
15. Without God’s Spirit, as you know,
No man the way of Christ can go,
Nor can he grasp the Lord God’s deeds
Or pray aright, for he must, needs
Receive the Spirit of the truth,
Withheld still from the world uncouth.
Since you ask me which way to go,
I humbly tell you what I know:
16. Forsake your wretched, sinful ways
And turn to God’s forgiving grace,
That through His Spirit you may be
Vouchsafed the gift your sins to see,
May get a new heart filled with light
And also learn to pray aright.
When you then ask Him, He will give
Whatever you may need to live
As He desires; hence spare no pain!
The Lord’s help you will surely gain,

For He will never leave His own.
17. “Oh Thou who art my Lord alone,
Inscribe Thy law into my heart,
That I may never from it part.
But ever bear good fruit for Thee
And walk on Thy way joyfully,
An obedient child of Thine–
Give me of Thy grace divine!'
18. Who will repent, to God draw near,
Should listen to this teaching clear.
He must resolve to fight all sin,
Do those things God takes pleasure in
And cleave to Him in all his ways.
So will he taste the Lord God’s Grace–
God: Father, Son, and Spirit–three,
And yet one God in unity,
In whose name we must baptized be.
19. “Oh, that my people would know me
And for my kindness grateful be,
That they might trust me as my flock
And safely build on me, their rock!
If they would walk in their Lord’s ways,
I would raise them from disgrace–
Heirs of my Kingdom they would be
And share its joys eternally.' Amen.
***********

What the Church Is, and How One May Become Part Of It
1. The Church of Christ is the gathering of the believing and devout, the
people of God who have given up the sinful life. We are led into this
gathering by true submission. It is the spiritual ark of Noah, in which we
can be preserved.

2. It is no human institution but a work of God. Just as Mary conceived
Christ through faith and the Holy Spirit by placing her will in God’s will
and saying. “Here am I, a handmaiden of the Lord. Let it be with me
according to Thy words,' so we must also receive and accept Christ in
faith. Then He will also begin and complete His work in us.
3. The Church has the key and authority to loose and to bind as Christ has
commanded, to exclude the evil and to accept the repentant, so that this is
binding in Heaven in accordance with the words of Christ. (Matthew
16:19)
4. Each should first count the cost carefully as to what he has to give up.
But he should not counsel with flesh and blood. For those who would enter
God’s service must be prepared to be attacked and to die for the truth and
for the Name of Christ, if it be God’s will, by water, fire, or the sword. For
now we have house and shelter, but we do not know what today or
tomorrow will bring. Therefore no one should join for the sake of good
days. He who is not prepared to endure evil and good with all the believers
and to accept as good whatever the Lord gives and ordains should leave it
alone. (Luke 14: 26-33)
We will not put pressure on anyone who does not join of his own free will.
We desire to persuade no one with smooth words. It is not a matter of
human compulsion from without or within, for God wants voluntary
service. Whoever cannot do this with joy and to the delight of his soul
should therefore leave it alone and remain in his former station.
5. No one should take this step for the sake of another–the wife for her
husband’s sake or the husband for his wife’s sake. or the children for the
sake of their parents, [a boy for the sake of a girl, or a girl for the sake of a
boy]. That would be in vain and built on sand. It cannot endure.
Instead, each one should build on the Rock, Christ, purely to please God
alone; for each must bear his own burden on the Day of Judgment.
6. Each must submit to and follow brotherly warning, admonition, and
discipline, and must practice the same toward others in the House of God,
so that no one may become co-guilty in the sins of another.
7. Each one should yield himself up in obedience to God and His Church
and not be obstinate or do only what he wants to do, but allow himself to
be placed wherever it is seen to be necessary for the good of the Church.
8.
No one any longer owns anything, for each gives and surrenders
himself to the Lord and His church with all that he has and can do, as it

was in the first Apostolic Church, in which no one said of his goods that
they were his own, but they had all things in common. (Acts 4:32) This we
hold to be the surest way and the most perfect foundation; we are well
assured of this in our hearts.
9.
We say this clearly to each one now in advance so that there is no
obligation to return anything to anyone later. Therefore, if anyone should
enter on this way and then cannot continue and should wish to have what
was his own returned, let him stay away now, keep what is his, and leave
us in peace. Our concern is not to get money and goods, but to win Godfearing hearts.
10. Whoever has had wrong dealings that are punishable in the world–be it
that he is in debt or has cheated someone–or if anyone has gotten himself
involved in matters of marriage or is engaged to be married, he must first
straighten out all these matters. For if someone should hide any of these
things from us and let himself be baptized and we should afterward learn
about these things, we would have to exclude him as one who did not come
into the Church rightly, but by falsehood. Therefore let each be warned.
(From the early Hutterian Church)

The Apostles' Creed
I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried: He
descended into Hell:
the third day He rose again from the dead.
He ascended into Heaven,
and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
one holy Christian Church, the fellowship of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.

Baptism Questions
Before the prayer: (addressed to baptismal group)
Do you recognize the teachings of Jesus, which have been laid before you,
to be the truth and the true foundation of blessedness? (Answer all: Yes)
Do you believe in and agree with the twelve points of the Christian faith,
and will you diligently witness to them? (Answer all: Yes. Together the
baptismal group recites the 12 articles of faith, or the Apostles’ Creed)
Do you desire the intercession of the Church so that God may forgive and
remit the sins you have committed either knowingly or in ignorance?
(Answer all: Yes)
Do you desire to yield, to give, and to sacrifice yourselves to God the Lord
in the covenant of Christian baptism? (Answer all: Yes)
After the prayer, each one is asked the following six questions while
kneeling:
Have you now understood enough of the Word of the Lord to recognize it
as the way to eternal life? (Answer: Yes)
Are you sorry with all your heart for the sins you have committed against
God, either knowingly or in ignorance? And do you henceforth want to
fear God and never willfully sin against Him anymore, but rather die than
willfully do anything against Him? (Answer: Yes)
Do you believe that God, through Christ and the intercession of His
people, has forgiven and remitted your sins? (Answer: Yes)
Do you desire to accept brotherly admonition and discipline and also to
use it toward others when necessary? (Answer: Yes)
Do you desire to give and sacrifice yourself to the Lord in Heaven with
body and soul and all that you have, and to yield yourself in obedience to
Christ and His Church? (Answer: Yes)
Do you desire to make a covenant with God and with all His people and to
be baptized on confession of your faith? (Answer: Yes)

The servant (and his assistant) now baptizes the individual by pouring on
of water, saying the following words:
On the confession of your faith I baptize you in the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit.
(With the laying on of hands:) May the almighty God in heaven, who
through the death of Christ and the prayers of his church, has shown you
grace and mercy, fill you with power from on high, and write your name in
the book of life, and keep you henceforth true and pious onto death. Amen.
(With hand extended to individual:) Stand up, my brother (sister); the
peace of God is with you.
(Person receiving baptism answers:) The Lord be with us.

Sample Prayer Insert
We also ask for our beloved ones who have asked to be baptized. Oh
beloved God, we ask for Thy blessing upon this baptism. We ask that their
faith be increased, that this covenant may be a power to stand firm in their
faith and whole walk of life. We ask for Thy Holy Spirit to descend upon
each one, that Thy Spirit only may rule, lead and guide at all times. And
may they submit themselves wholeheartedly to Thy Spirit, also to be
truthful to the Church, submitting themselves to sacrifice body and soul
with all possessions, and no more to claim anything any more as their
own.
We also ask for remission of their sins which they have committed in
ignorance, also willingly and unwillingly. Oh God, forgive them, and we
all as Thy Church ask to receive them as members of Thy Church. Help
them to be dead to sin, and no more to sin willingly, but rather to die than
to sin any more.

What Baptism Is

A confession of true repentance for committed sin.
A privilege that is only right and proper to accept, a reminder that one
must no longer live in sin, but for God.
A witness to and a sealing of the truth one has embraced through Christ.
The destruction of the old man, and the resurrection to a new life coming
from God.
A sign that, through the Word of truth, one has been born a member of the
Body of Christ together with all believers.
A firm avowal and declaration of a good conscience with God.
The true assurance that one comes from death into life as long as one
remains, as it is written, 'firmly grounded in faith.'
