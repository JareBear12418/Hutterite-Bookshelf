1528 to 1959
***************

HOW CHRISTIANITY SPREAD AND THE FIRST
The large volumes or details in the Hutter Church Chronicle will
interest historians but not the average man. That is the reason why the
average Hutterite knows so little about his history, as interesting as his
history is. Reading these large volumes is, to them, like looking for a
needle in a haystack, and he finds not enough interest. We shall try and
relate their history very briefly and present it as simply as possible. We
will include their contacts with the Swiss and Low German Mennonites,
the early days and now.
Several incidents in my life induced me to study the Hutterite history
from the days when I was a young boy. My parents lived close to Wolf
Creek Colony, and the elderly people of the colony called me “Little
Bohemian” just to tease me. I did not like that and complained at home to
Grandma, who lived with us, and my parents. They all said there was
nothing wrong with that, because Mendel’s were Bohemian. When old

folks from the neighborhood gathered at our home, I so often heard the
statement in their conversations that our people (Hutterites) were from all
corners of the world. We are here justified telling those who do not know
where these four corners are. Some of our information is from a book
written by Min. Jacob Wipf, who died at the Elm Spring Colony over 60
years ago. When the Hutterites moved to South Russia from North Russia
in 1842, he was the first one prepared for a teacher and was sent to High
School at Halbstadt where the low-Germans lived. He was one of the
school teachers of Hutterite villages. He no doubt knew all the Hutterite
people personally. The book he wrote was never printed. Consequently,
there is only one copy and we are in possession of this copy. Many years
ago it was given to us as a gift through circumstantial development, due to
the fact that we were always interested in Hutterite history.

We never thought of writing this short history but took an interest in the
history only to satisfy our own desire. But, after publishing the Freeman
Courier for many years and many far away reading the paper and noticing
that we knew the history quite well, were asked by quite a few to write
them a short history of the Hutterite people. Our time is too limited to
write each one individually so we conceived the idea of printing a very
brief history. It seems a person gets more interested in his people when he
gets older. His birthplace becomes an interesting spot and the place where
he spent his childhood days he can never forget. We were only three
months old when our parents left Russia, yet we take special interest in
Russia. This book is dedicated to the Pioneer Hutterites or America

HUTTERITE COLONY STARTED
The Christian History begins after Christ ascended to Heaven. The
Jews and Gentiles told the young Christian generation that Jesus was

stolen from the grave. That is why the grave was empty. This made many
of the young Christians doubt whether that resurrection story was true and
the Christian Church worried about their young generation. So, the
Christian generation sent a delegation of Christians to Rome to see the
Emperor. The Jerusalem country belonged to Rome and when they arrived
in Rome they asked the Emperor what Pilate of Jerusalem wrote about
Jesus. The Emperor handed Pilate’s letter to them and the letter written by
Pilate and the Emperor said this: Something happened here that we cannot
figure out. We crucified the man Jesus because there were so many
complaints against him. He was buried, the grave sealed, yet after three
days he walked around with his friends for 40 days then ascended to
heaven. So, Pilate became the biggest witness. The delegation went back
home to Jerusalem and this report wiped away all the doubt about the
resurrection. But Rome kept on persecuting the Christians and many were
killed during Emperor Nero’s reign and his wife was blamed because she
belonged to the Jews. For many years the Christians went through terrible
suffering until Constantine became Emperor of Rome. He was good to the
Christians, helped them, appointed them to office in many cases. This
ended their troubles and Christianity spread all over and that became the
Catholic Church. The Church located one Bishop in Rome and one in
Constantinople to do mission work in Austria. He spread the gospel over a
large field in Austria but the highest authority was still in Rome. In the
course of time the Bishop in Constantinople did not agree with Rome on
some questions and they separated. The Bishop in Constantinople worked
north into Russia and this is called the Greek Catholic Church. This makes
the Catholic Church the oldest Christian Church in the World. The next
important religious move was the Reformation by the Great Man of God,
Martin Luther. His father intended to prepare him for a lawyer but
Martin’s choice was church work.
In 1725, Felix Manz, Conrad Grebel, George Blaurock and Balthaser
Hubmeier started the Anabaptist movement, and the movement soon
spread all over Europe. They opposed child baptism and the first that were
baptized in Switzerland were: Mantz, Grebel, Blaurock and Balthaser.
They started the Anabaptist Church move and the move soon spread all
over Europe.

The birthplace of the Mennonite Church was in Zurich, Switzerland,
where the above four were baptized first and started the Anabaptists. This
history is dedicated to the pioneer men and women who did so much to
pave the way for the community and we reserve the deeds of these
pioneers, both living and those who are gone to the great beyond. Today
we are on the threshold of a new era and we must have the same foresight
which brought pioneer men and women to this community. Let us move
forward with steadfast purpose and confidence. Only then will we be
worthy of the trust which was left to us by these pioneers.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION
When this was written in 1959 the Hutterite history covered a period
of 430 years. The first 240 years they lived in Austria, Hungary, Moravia
and other localities and is a story of persecution. From 1552 to 1592 was a
peaceful period and 50 colonies were established with a population of
about 15000 souls. The first communistic colony was established in 1528,
20 miles north of Pressburg in Austria.
When they emigrated to North Russia in 1770 their number of souls
was less than one-hundred and thirteen families. In 1842 when they moved
to South Russia from North Russia they again counted 69 families, 205
male and 210 female. When they emigrated to America in 1874 they
numbered 169 families. This gives you a superficial picture.
***************

CHURCH CONDITIONS IN 1500
To understand the Hutterite history you must go back to the Reformation
time and look at the church conditions of those days. It reminds you of

what Prophet Isaiah said: Chapter 80, Verse 2: “For behold, the darkness
shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall rise
thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee.”
The enemies of the Christian Church at first were the Jews and the
Gentiles. Many years after the ascension of Christ, Emperor Constantine
was the ruler of the Roman Empire and he was very friendly to the
Christians and counted himself as one.
This condition created political influence in the Christian Church and
ultimately formed and developed the Catholic Church which as a state
Church, had absolute control of church problems until the great man of
God, Martin Luther, started the Reformation in 1517. All those with
Luther protesting against the rules were called Protestants. People were
either Protestants or Catholics. This divided the labor group working for
Lichtenstein Brothers. One faction said it was wrong for Lichtenstein to
tell Ahnly not to touch anybody because the Emperor’s instructions were
not being carried out. The other faction said the instructions were good
and they kept on arguing the question. Lichtenstein listened for a while
then said he did not want two factions on the place and all those who
thought he had done wrong by telling the Emperor officer to not attack any
of his workers were to leave the place. He and 190 left the Lichtenstein
place with Jacob Wiedeman as their leader. He had four assistants and one
happened to be Bohemian by the name of Jacob Mandel.
The instruction from the Emperor was that all those working for
Lichtenstein Brothers must be Catholics or they would be punished.
Soon these Protestants were divided on the question of baptism. One group
believed in baptizing only adults and the other group believed in infant
baptism. This former class was called the Anabaptists (Wiedertäufer)
which means rebaptizer. The leaders of the Anabaptists were Felix Mantz,
Conrad Grebel, George Blaurock, and Balthouser Hubmeier. They were the
first rebaptized. These Anabaptists were persecuted and many fled to
Moravia, a province in Austria and now Czechoslovakia and other
countries.

Because of this religious liberty, Moravia became the asylum for the
persecuted in Switzerland, Germany, Holand, Belgium, Austria and other
countries where Anabaptists were found. The birthplace of the Mennonite
Church is in Zurich Switzerland.
The big band owners in Moravia were glad to have these persecuted
people on their estate to build the country, especially the two Lichtenstein
brothers, John and Leonard.
They controlled a big tract of Land and they also respected the
Anabaptists church questions and Leonard Lichtenstein was baptized by
Hubmeier. The name of this place was Nickelsburg.
In a short time many hundreds of Anabaptists gathered at this
locality, and Emperor Ferdinand watched developments at Nickelsburg.
One day he sent Prozus Ahnly, an officer with authority, to execute all
those at Nickelsburg who refused to go back to the Catholic Church.
When Ahnly approached Nickelsburg, Leonard Lichtenstein sent a
special messenger to meet Ahnly and told him if he wanted to save his life
he must go back home and Ahnly returned. Because a war broke out with
Turkey the Emperor had his hands full. Nothing was done to punish
Lichtenstein for his defiant act or Ahnly for neglecting his duty.
This divided the Anabaptists into two groups. One group contended
that it was wrong for Lichtenstein to threaten Ahnly with killing and the
other group opposed this contention and said it was not wrong.
Lichtenstein then advised the group that disagreed with him to leave the
place because there would be no harmony with two groups opposing each
other on the same place.
***************

HOW THE FIRST COLONY STARTED

In the Spring of 1523 a group of about 190 disagreeing with
Lichtenstein left the place with Jacob Wiedeman and their leader. He had
four to assist him and one happened to be a Bohemian by the name of
Jacob Maendel. On the way they were camping at a certain place. At this
camping place Jacob Wiedeman spread his coat on the ground in their
presence and said: “Let us do like the Apostles have done in Acts 2.” He
and everyone laid his possessions on that coat. Some needed help and
those that had possessions were willing to sacrifice. This was the
beginning of the first Hutterite Communistic Colony. The motive was to
help those that needed help and take care of them. Their circumstances
developed in such shape to convince them to see that the best move was to
do like the Apostles have done and eliminate the question of how much to
donate by donating all to help your brother. And, up to this day, 500 years
later, not one of their members was taken to a poor house, to a feeble
minded institution, Home for the Aged, etc. They take care of all of them
whether he is strong as a giant or helpless as a invalid
Many of the present day political and economic communists say if
communism works out successfully with the Hutterite Colonies why will it
not succeed in the state. Theoretically it seems that way but not in
practice. When people from research departments come with this question
our simple answer is: “If you take the religious background away from
these Hutterite Colonies that will be the beginning of the end of all the
Hutterite Colonies.”
Some years ago a chain or colonies called the Llano Colonies were
established in the southern states for economic purpose only. All died a
natural death. Not one is left today. At Jamesville south of Freeman a few
years ago South Dakota spent over $41,000.00 in less than a year to
establish a colony to help poor people to live cheaper. A little later the
place was sold to the present Jamesville Colony and they are prospering.
The conscience of the religious communist is trained to say, “What is mine
is also yours. I am my brothers keeper.” The political and economical
communist sees the quest from a different angle, and says, “What is yours
is also mine.” Modern political communism is the biggest question this
world is facing today.

***************

THE FIRST HUTTERITE COLONY ESTABLISHED IN
MORAVIA, AUSTRIA 1528
The group of people that left the Lichtenstein place with Wiedeman
as their leader had now organized as a Communistic organization. They
were invited by land owners at Austerlitz, Moravia and here is where the
first Communistic colony was established 1528, 20 miles north of
Pressburg, later called Hutterite Colony. Land Owners furnished them with
buildings and anything they needed.
About two years after the founding of this colony Jacob Hutter came
up from Tyrol, about 200 miles away, where the Anabaptists had much
opposition. He visited the colony and joined it. He was a hat maker by
trade. He was a very active and influential man and before long the colony
was named after him. The Hutterite Colony — Hut means in German
“hat.” So the name Hutterites really means “hat maker.” A few more
colonies were soon organized and established and after 50 years they had
some 50 colonies with a population of 15,000 writes Wiedeman in the
Rechenschaft a book that contains the articles of faith.
***************

OCCUPATION, SCHOOL, CHURCH
The heavy land owners were glad to have the Hutterites on their
estate because they were honest and industrious and helped to build up
their country. They had full confidence in them and paid no attention to
those who hated them, mocked and despised them or laughed when they
saw them pray before and after eating. All that made no impression on the
land lords. They listened more to statements like the Lutheran Church
historian Professor J. H. Kurtz made when he wrote about the Hutterites
and said, “They are noted for their sincere piety, exemplary discipline,

strict industry, fair and conscientious dealing, unexampled patience in
suffering and martyr courage and martyr joy.” Some of the men were
tilling the soil and many were working at different trades like blacksmith,
mason, watchmaker, tanner, furrier, shoemaker, potter, doctor, etc.
Everyone worked for the common good.
They paid much attention to their schools, believing that home,
school and church are responsible for the young generation. The teachers
were ordained for their work like ministers. After children were through
school every boy and every girl took an occupational training course
which prepared them for some kind of work which helped the colony much
in a material way. But, conditions became more unfavorable.
At first Moravia was tolerant, but in 1622 the Hutterites were forced
to leave and went to other places. They asked Mennonites for support and
received help from them. 1760 Empress Theresa asked that all children
must be baptized by a Catholic Priest. Their books were taken from them,
their ministers were thrown in prison. Catholic Priests brought the
message and Hutterites were compelled by soldiers to attend service.
Community of goods was given up for 14 years but was later introduced.
***************

THEIR NATIONALITY
,
The Anabaptist people and Lichtenstein brothers were persecuted
people coming from many countries in Europe. That is why the old
Hutterites so often said our people came from all four corners of the
world.,
***************

242 YEARS IN AUSTRIA

They lived 242 years in Austria. During their stay in Austria they
made their home in several provinces and also a short time they were
under Turkish control. So many died as martyrs. They were never
persecuted for Communistic living. Infant baptism, not swearing and the
nonresistant doctrine, were the three causes for persecutions by the state
church. Thousands died but remained faithful. It’s indescribable how they
were tortured, burned, torn with irons, roasted on beams, locked up in a
house and all burned together, hanged to a tree beheaded, gags put into
their mouths, so they could not testify before dying. Whole colonies just
disappeared during these persecution days but many found each other
again. The methods of persecution were beyond description. The
persecution leaders aimed for the leaders first. After they had the leaders,
and the prominent members of the colony, others left in discouragement.
Young men were offered prominent government positions and easy living
if they would give up their faith. But, many young men sooner died as
martyrs than accept a prominent position and a good time.
***************

MOVE TO RUSSIA
After going through many storms and much distress during the 242
years in Austria and over 3 years in Hungary, a door opened in Russia. The
heart of prominent Russian war general, Samitin, was touched and he had
sympathy for them when they fled to the Walachia in Turkey. This general
advised them to emigrate to Russia where they would find religious
freedom. He gave them a wagon and a team of oxen, and necessary papers
to cross the line into Russia. He also advised them to see the field
Marshall of Russia, Count Romanzof. They accepted this advice and
started on their journey to Russia with five ox teams, some cows and some
sheep. On their journey they went through many hardships and often
prayed for a time when they could eat enough bread to satisfy their hunger.
Russia and Turkey were at war and many times they were robbed and
mistreated by soldiers on the highways. They left the main roads and

traveled through valleys and hills without a road so as not to be seen by
Turkish soldiers who followed the main roads to destroy towns.
***************

ARRIVED AT WISCHENKA, RUSSIA 1770
Wischenka in North Russia was their destination and when they came
closer to Wischenka Count Romanzof sent 10 Cossack soldiers to meet
them and take care of them. Some left wives and children in Austria and
they were brought later where it was possible.,
***************

THEY LEFT WISCHENKA
They left Walachia, where they had stayed about two years in
Hungary. The other years to make up the 242 years, were spent in Austria.
They arrived in Wischenka April 10, 1770. They entered into contract with
Romanzof and had a home again. Count Romanzof was very good to them
and advanced them money to start. Less than 100 souls made up the group,
13 families. When those still in Austria heard the good news that they had
found a home and were enjoying a religious liberty many more came to
Russia and joined them. It might be mentioned why Russia was so
tolerant. When Catherina the II ascended the throne in Russia she was
convinced the people of Russia would never build up Russia. She was
looking for German settlers. She cannot be admired as a character, but she
was a shrewd ruler. Large tracts of land were not developed. Europe was
always in a turmoil of war, just like today. Catherina II was shrewd enough
to know that the common people never want war, the rulers cause the wars.
She was looking for settlers that would build up her country. The best
inducement she could think of was to offer exemption from military
service for 100 years to all the Germans that came to Russia to live. They
were also granted full religious liberty. When this news spread, German
people from Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria flocked to Russia

and met a warm reception in Russia. All the Germans coming to Russia to
live had to promise to do no mission work in Russia. The people of Russia
belonged to the Greek Catholic Church and should not be disturbed in
religion.
***************

WISCHENKA COLONY — A BUSY PLACE
There was great activity at Wischenka Colony. The men folks were
well trained in their trades and were busy at work early and late in the
fields or in the shop. They were also very particular about their school.
They even had a kindergarten department where children were admitted at
the age of 3 years. They soon had their own doctor, Dr. Wurz, but he left
the colony with 3 children and went to Moscow. After Dr. Wurz left, Dr.
Sam Wipf was their doctor. Later Dr. Ephrahim Gross, grandfather of Min.
Paul F. Gross of Freeman, S. Dak., was the colony doctor. He left the
colony also, but his wife and three children remained.
Two other young men prepared for the doctor profession, but they left
the colony when they were ready to practice. There were no medical
schools like today. They took a course at the office of Count Romanzof ’s
family doctor.
***************

NEW MEMBERS JOINED THE HUTTERITE COLONY
While at Wischenka the colony received new members. When the
forefathers of the East Freeman people, the Swiss Mennonites, left
Switzerland and moved to Northern Austria they stayed there only about 7
years. Then they moved to Russia and settled down in Russia, Poland in
1797.
Several stayed with the Hutterite Colony for sometime but nearly all
left again to join their people. Four brothers were Millers: John, Jacob,
Joseph and Peter, — John and Jacob went back to their people in Poland,

Russia but Joseph and Peter stayed in the colony. Joseph Miller’s children
were all daughters. Peter Miller was the grandfather of the late Jos. A.
Miller in Freeman, father of Mrs. John J. Tschetter, the banker in Freeman.
SD and a cousin to the late Min. Christ Mueller in East Freeman. Mathias
Hofer came to Wischenka after he was in prison for 16 years. The Gross
family came from Andrew Gross of Hungary and he joined the colony in
1781. Jacob Walter went back to Hungary to get his family.
The Deckers are descendants of two Prussian widows who came with
their children and joined the colony. We made a special search for our own
forefathers and find that Paul Mandel, a Mr. Tital and a Mr. Wollman,
everyone single, joined the colony in 1780. The name Tital disappeared
because his children were all daughters. Joseph C. Kleinsasser and Peter C.
Kleinsasser were grandsons of this man Tital. Tital’s daughter, Mary, was
married to Math Kleinsasser, grandfather of Jos C. and Peter C.
Kleinsasser.
From the above mentioned Wollmann all the Wollmanns descend.
These three men came from Austria. Paul Maendel was a Bohemian, was
baptized by Min. Kuhr, Dec. 10, 1783, and died in Hutterthal in 1846. We
often heard our grandmother say he had a Bohemian tongue and could
never talk the Hutterite language correctly. He always had that Bohemian
accent.
It was in the latter 1790’s that the three Schrag sisters, Anna, Maria,
and Katharina joined the Hutterite colony. They had made their home with
their brother at the Swiss Mennonites, East Freeman people. Their brother
had no children. These three sisters were very conscientious in church
matters. The Swiss Mennonites practiced feet washing after the Lord’s
Supper was served, but the Hutterites did not practice feet washing. So,
these three sisters went into a room alone to do it because their conscience
was trained to practice feet washing.
Maria Schrag was married to Min. John L. Wipf ’s father Johann
Wipf. Anna Schrag was married to George Waldner, father of John W.
Tschetter’s mother. Katherina Schrag was married to George Waldner’s
brother Johann Waldner, who died. His widow with two sons and one
daughter went back to her people in Poland. One of these boys was the

grandfather of the late Peter M. Waldner, father of Professor Ben P.
Waltner, former Freeman College teacher. All the East Freeman Waltner’s
are descendents of these two boys. The name was changed to Waltner from
Waldner.
The second husband of Maria Schrag was Enoch Kleinsasser. Her first
husband died and left her with two sons and three daughters. The son John
was the father of the late Min. John L. Wipf and the son Joseph was the
father of the late Dr. A. A. Wipf ’s father. One daughter was married to
Abraham in Canada, one daughter was married to Peter Entz and the
descendants are all members of the Elm Spring Colony. Maria, the third
daughter, was the mother of Joseph Pullman, father of the late Jake J.
Pollman of Freeman.
The second husband of Maria Schrag was Enoch Kleinsasser. The
writer knew him personally and caught many frogs for him for fishing.
This may sound like a fish story but is a fact. This man, Enoch, was close
to 90 years old and I was a kid of some 4 years. Enoch was an uncle to our
grandmother and she was staying at our home near Wolf Creek Colony
now called the “Wolf Creek Colony Place” by the public.
This Maria Schrag had two daughters with her second husband. One
was the first wife of Min. John Waldner who died in Freeman after he left
Jamesville Colony. The second daughter was the first wife of Michael
Hofer who at the age of 103 years died. The Min. John Waldner was the
step-father of the late Dr. J. H. Wipf of Freeman.
Another party joining the colony at Wischenka was Mrs. Anna Witte
of Danzig. Her husband, a merchant,-- died and her son disappeared so she
and her daughter joined the colony. Her daughter was married to John
Waldner and this Waldner was the grandfather of the late Mrs. Min. John
L. Wipf mother of Mrs. John K. Hofer (Druggist).
***************

COLONY WAS PROSPERING

The colony was prospering at Wischenka and their membership
increased wonderfully. Church work received much attention. Under the
pressure they had passed for so many years, there was a danger for some to
become fanatic and radical and some prominent members were affected. A
Hofer contended that Jesus never ate breakfast and followers of Christ
should not eat breakfast. He also insisted that all prayers should be spoken
so all can hear the prayers. When the colony declined to obey his advice he
left the colony and stayed with a Wiebe family in Prussia and never came
back. His wife remained in the colony. A Kleinsasser insisted to have
prayer meetings at 12 o’clock at night because or Psalm 119 verse 62. And
they had few similar cases where members went to extremes.
***************

THE GOOD DAYS ENDED
The good days ended when Count Romanzof died and his son took
affairs into his own hands. His aim was to reduce the Hutterite Colony to
serfdom. To avoid that, the colony petitioned the Czar. John Waldner and
Jacob Walter personally went to St. Petersburg to present a petition to the
Czar Alexander I in 1801. The Czar offered them crown land 15 miles
from Wishenka near the river Desna. During their 32 years stay in
Wishenka 172 died and are buried at Wishenka. When Romanzof heard
about the name he threatened them with trouble and told the Czar about it,
but the Czar said, “No worry, I will protect the colony.”
***************

30 YEARS AT RADITSHAWA
In 1802 they left Wishenka and moved to the other place. The crown
advanced them $4,000.00 to build the new place, the money to be paid
back in 10 years. In this place the Hutterites made poor history. The
trouble is mostly attributed to a certain extent to conditions there.
The influence of a small Russian station next to their door caused
trouble. How far to keep away from outside influence and how tolerant to

be is a delicate question. The conservative class and the liberal class
disagreed on the question of how far to go in the association with outsiders
and in this case with Russian outsiders. To go to extreme is a human
weakness and it was the extremists that divided the people into two
groups, the liberals and the conservatives. In a divided house there is no
cooperation. The constant friction between the two groups, the Min. John
Waldner group, the liberals, and the Min. Darius Walter group the
conservatives ended in disbanding and was caused by trouble within their
own gates. They discontinued community life in 1819 of their own
volition and lived in two small villages privately. Another cause for
disbanding just at this time was a fire that destroyed their buildings. This
Min. Walter was the grandfather of the Darius Walter who was the leader
in establishing the Wolf Creek Colony west of Freeman in 1874. The small
Russian station close to the colony caused their trouble and they now lived
in a timber country chopping wood.
When we visited Mr. Zimmerman, general manager of the Amana
Society at Amana, Iowa, for a week in 1922, he said that a colony should
never be located close to a town. They felt the influence from Cedar
Rapids, a city close to the seven Amana Colonies.
***************

HUTTERITES CONTACTS WITH SWISS AND LOW
GERMANS
The Hutterites, the Swiss Mennonites in Poland and the Low German
Mennonites in South Russia were always in touch with each other. The
Hutterites knew that the low Germans in South Russia were prosperous
and the low Germans in South Russia knew that the Hutterites were
poverty stricken, and had a hard struggle some 600 miles north. John
Cornies wrote the Czar about their condition. John Cornies of South
Russia was a very influential man at home and with the government. He
was sent to Raditshawa with a government man to see what could be done.
A trip of 650 miles in a buggy to see if they could do something for the
Hutterites.

Michael R. Hofer, who died at Freeman, South Dakota on October
25th, 1932, at the age of 103 years was born in Raditchawa on August 4th,
1829, and was 13 years old when Cornies and the government man came to
Raditchawa. Hofer always enjoyed telling us how it happened. The
government man gave orders that every family go out to the front of their
home. When they were all out Cornies and the government man drove
through the street slowly to take a good look at all the faces and when they
came to the end of the street the government man said to Cornies, “They
look like a group in good health. If you are willing to assume the duty of
managing people, let them move down to South Russia into the
Molatschna district.” Cornies said he would. That closed the deal. In 1842,
the Hutterites, 69 families: 205 male and 210 female, moved to South
Russia.
***************

IN SOUTH RUSSIA 1842 TO 1874
The first village they built in South Russia was Hutterthal in 1842.
The second village they built was Johannesruh in 1853 and was two miles
away from Hutterthal. At Johannesruh all were brick buildings.
The third village was Hutterdorf, started in 1859 and located 130
miles away on the west side of Duieper River. In 1868 about 200 miles
away New Hutterthal started on the west side of the Duieper. Just before
emigrating to America people from Hutterdorf started a village called
Sheromet in 1874, but very little was done there. The crown advanced the
Hutterites 15,000 rubel to start in 1842 but by this time all was paid back
to the crown.
***************

CORNIES HAS DONE MUCH WORK FOR HUTTERITES
Cornies helped them in many ways. He started evening schools for
those not able to read or write because in Raditchawa schools were
neglected. The regular school work during the day was in the charge of

able teachers from Malotschna. In the course of time the village sent
young men to the Malotschna high school in Halbstadt. Two of the young
men sent were Peter Gross, a brother of the late George Gross who is the
father of John G. Gross. He died northwest of Bismark, N. Dak., some 40
years ago. The other young man sent to the high school in Halbstadt was
Jacob Wipf, known to old people by the name of Jacob-lehrer (Jacob
Teacher). He died at the Rockport Colony on June 6, 1896. He was the
leader or founder of the Lehrerleut.
***************

LIVING IN SOUTH RUSSIA
While living in South Russia the Hutterite people were more or less
divided in church work. Conscience can be trained and many were still
communistically minded or inclined despite the fact that they disbanded in
1819 and had no common ownership since that time. In their reading
service in church some sermons were strong in favor of common
ownership and some ministers struck out the clauses that emphasized
common ownership, which suited the group not in favor of common
ownership, but the conscience of the older people was trained for common
ownership. More than one attempt was made to organize part of the village
as a colony and leave the others in the village in private ownership but it
turned out to be a failure. Be that as it may, the people were very
prosperous during their stay in South Russia and the time came when the
two groups could separate with less trouble and that was when the Russian
government withdrew the
exemption of military service which all the Germans enjoyed for 100
years. Regardless of church affiliation, the Hutterite now looked for a
location in America. Each one had his choice. The Hutterite in favor of
private life located on the farm. Those in favor of common-ownership
could join a colony here in America.
***************

NOW MOVING TO AMERICA

A delegation was sent to America by the Swiss Mennonites. The
Poland Mennonites living in South Russia and the Hutterites decided to
send 2 delegates. The delegation consisted of 12 men: Wm. Ewert, Jacob
Buller, Tobias Unruh, Jacob Peters, Henry Wiebe, Cor. Baur, Cour. Toews,
David Klaasen, Leonard Suderman, Andrew Schrag, Min. Paul J. Tschetter,
Lorentz Tschetter. The second last named was Min. D. W. Tschetter’s
father and the last one named was our grandfather.
They sailed from Hamburg, Germany, May 14, 1873. After seeing
Minnesota, Canada, Dakota Territory, Nebraska and other states, the
Tschetter picked Red River Valley, in North Dakota as first choice. On the
way back home they stopped in Elkhart, Indiana and other Mennonite
settlements. Mr. Hiller was the N. P. Railway land agent at an annual
salary of $5,000.00, and he was the man who introduced them to President
Grant.
When the two Hutterite delegates returned to Russia, they reported
conditions here and it was decided to sell out and emigrate to America.
Hutterdorf and their branch Colony Sheromet were the first to leave in the
spring of 1874. Another group that left in 1874 were five families of the
New Hutterthal village, namely Min. Paul J. Tschetter, Joseph Tschetter,
Jacob Tschetter, Josua Hofer, Joseph Hofer. They came as far as Elkhart,
Indiana, where they stayed over the winter.
The land agents here got busy and met the Hutterdorf people in New
York. Instead of going to the selected land in Red River Valley, N. Dak.,
that the delegates had selected, they went to Lincoln. Nebraska. It was
very hot and dry at Lincoln that summer in July, and 36 children died.
Also, a Darius Stahl who was born in Wischenka in North Russia, died.
They all got discouraged and left for Yankton. They knew Daniel
Unruh went there in 1873 and settled in Dakota. He met our 2 delegates in
New York, so they decided to leave for Yankton. When they arrived in
Yankton they could not take out their baggage. It was garnisheed $500.00
to pay their boarding place at Lincoln. They used their money and paid it.
The land agent at Lincoln had promised them everything free but, they
learned now that was conditional in case they locate at Lincoln.

***************

JUST TWO COLONIES ESTABLISHED
This Lincoln group established the first two Hutterite Colonies in S.
Dak., the Bon Homme Colony and the Wolf Creek Colony. Min. (Schmied)
Michael Waldner was the leader of the Bon Homme Colony. Min. Darius
Walter was the leader of the Wolf Creek Colony. The Bon Homme Colony
bought the Burleigh ranch, their present location, for $25,000.00. The Wolf
Creek Colony settled down east of Silver Lake on 29 Quarters at the
present Schartner place. After spending one winter at Silver Lake in the
spring or 1875 they bought the present Wolf Creek Colony placefor
$750.00 and moved to the place the same spring. The Jim River was the
inducement where they could open a mill by water power.
In 1877 another group of Hutterites came from Russia with Min.
Jacob Wipf and Min. Peter Hofer. Both were leaders and established Elm
Spring Colony. These are the three original colonies.
***************

SEPARATION TIME FOR HUTTERITES,
,
The Hutterites now had a good chance to decide private homes or
colony homes. Upon arriving from Russia those favoring colony life
joined a colony. Those favoring private life settled down on a farm. The
groups settled about 50-50. From 1874 to 1879 some Hutterites arrived
from Russia every year. In 1879 the last people arrived. Min. Michael
Waldner and Joseph Waldner from Bon Homme Colony were sent to
Russia and the mission was to induce new comers to join the colony. The
men and women who married Low Germans remained with them.,
***************

CONTACT WITH LOW GERMANS IN SOUTH RUSSIA.

During their stay in South Russia near the Low Germans who were
there since 1790 and were wealthy, many of the Hutterite girls worked for
the German families and some were married to Low Germans. Those
classes of people associated more or less. Some young men were married
to Low German girls. The father of the late Elias G. Wipf had a brother
who was married to a Low German lady and this family resided at Inma,
Kansas. One of their daughters was married to Min. J. Esau, and one of the
Esau daughters is the wife of Paul Hofer of Hutchinson, Kansas. Min. John
L. Wipf ’s sister Elizabeth was married to Mr. Goosen and one of their
daughters became the second wife of Min. Paul Gross (Parkuhl Vetter).
When Dr. A. A. Wipf ’s grandfather died in Russia the widow married a
Stahl. This was the father of Mr. D. R. M. Hofer’s father George Stahl,
who died in Freeman. Their children are Stahls and live in South America.
When Dr. A. M. Lorentz was in South America he met one of these Stahls.
A William Fast was married to a Hutterite girl and when she died the
children were adopted by Hutterites in Russia. Daniel Wurz adopted Jake
Fast. Andrew Miller adopted John Fast. Paul Hofer adopted Mary Fast.
Jacob Janzen married a sister of Min. Michael Waldner of Bon Homme
Colony and the family stayed with the Hutterites. They were the parents of
the late C. J. Janzen of Parkstadt, and Joe A. Glanzer’s mother.
In 1932 when we were in Alberta, Canada we met an Unger and he
happened to be the son of Mr. Unger who married our mother’s aunt,
Barbara Tschetter. At Saskatoon, Canada we happened to meet a man by
the name Boldt who was a cousin to the late Mrs. John M. S. Hofer.
Millionaire Wollman married a step daughter. This millionaire Wollman
was a brother to Franz Wollman who settled down northwest of the Wolf
Creek Colony when he arrived from Russia. The late Franz Wollman of
Beadle was his grandson.
***************

NOW ALL IN AMERICA
At the end of 1879 all the Hutterites were here in America, settled
down either in one of the colonies or on a farm. In Russia they lived in the

following villages.
***************

RESIDENTS OF HUTTERITE DORFS IN RUSSIA
Compiled by Arnold M. Hofer
In his book, History of the People of the Freeman Area printer J. J. Mendel
gives a list of the family heads of the residents of Hutterthal and of New
Hutterthal. Of those living in Hutterdorf and Johannesruh he also lists the
wife’s name. Of those in Scheromet he merely says that eleven families
from Hutterdorf founded it shortly before coming to America. Who those
eleven were we can only speculate. Since they all came to America in
1874 on the same ship with the Hutterdorf people it may be possible to
glean most of them from the list of those passengers. This I have not
done.
The Centennial Committee thought that there would be interest on the
part of some to know the identity of these residents from the different
villages. So, in as much as possible, they were identified with their
passenger number on the ship list of passengers as contained in our 1974
publication, The History of the Hutterite Mennonites. Also, their
commonly used nicknames, that I felt were not offensive, were also used
for identification purposes.
Upon investigation, one finds that the ship lists contain families not
found in Mendel’s list. One reason for that is that, whatever source Mendel
had for his list, it does not appear to be complete. Another is that new
families were formed after the list was compiled. For Johannesruh, we
know from other records that 1872 was census time. It probably is the
same for the other villages but we cannot be certain.

Sl stands for Schmiedeleut Family records
Some notes, nicknames and numbers were added by David Gross

When the Hutterites moved to Russia in 1770 they counted 13
families, less than 100 souls. In 1842 when they moved to South Russia
they had 69 families. When they moved to America in 1874-1879, 152
families.
The ministers of Hutterdorf and Sheromet were Min. William
Tschetter, Min. David Waldner and Min. Darius Walter served the part of
the village organized as a colony while Min. David Waldner served the
part of the village that lived privately in Russia.
***************

THE THREE COLONIES AFTER 30 YEARS
The statistical report of the three organized colonies: Bon Homme,
Wolf Creek, and Elmspring shows great prosperity. The first 30 years their
number increased to 242 families, living in 12 different colonies. The Bon
Homme group included Milltown, Rosedale, Maxwell, Beadle. The Wolf
Creek group included Spink, Tschetter, Jamesville, and the Elm Spring
group included Rockport and New Elm Spring.
Moving to America was separating time of those favoring colony life,
and those favoring private ownership were: Bon Homme and Wolf Creek
settled in 1874 and Elm Spring in 1877. Wolf Creek settled just east of
Silver Lake where they owned 29 quarters, but stayed there only one year
then moved to Wolf Creek Colony place in 1875.

SOME MOVE TO PENNSYLVANIA
We shall give a brief account of some of the moves made by the
colonies in 1884. Several families of the Bon Homme Colonies moved to
Economy, Pennsylvania where the Rappish communistic colony was
located. After staying there for two years, they returned with the exception
of Sam Kleinsasser, who died a few years ago. When these families came
back from the Roppish colony they bought the Milltown place in 1886.
Four young men west of Freeman namely, Geo D. Hofer, Sam Wipf, Paul
F. Gross and Jacob J. Wollman, also went to the Roppish Colony. After
staying there for some time all four returned. That colony was founded by
O. Rappe in 1730 but at this time was in charge of Henritz and Lentz. They
were very strict in church regulations. If a member slept during service he
was called by name and he sure remained awake after that. The colony
owned oil wells and was worth 80 million. Only single persons could be
members. Their will stipulated, “If only 6 members are left one third goes
to the United States, one third to friends in Germany, and the rest to the six
members left.”
***************

A COLONY AT TRIPP

Just before 1880 fifteen men of the Bon Homme colony filed on land
at Tripp at two places to start a colony. After about two years they sold out
to Tiedeman and Taylor and moved to Economy, Pa., for two years and
then bought the Milltown place.
***************

A COLONY IN CANADA
In 1898 the Wolf Creek Colony started a Colony at Dominion City,
Manitoba, Canada but later sold out and bought the Lake Byron place in
Beadle in 1905.
***************

CONTACT WITH AMANA IOWA COLONIES
The colonies here were in close touch with the seven Amana, Iowa
colonies. In 1880, eighteen-year-old Michael Hofer of Bon Homme
Colony, brother of Jacob Hofer, the Wolf Creek Blacksmith, went to the
Amana Society in Iowa to receive medical treatment for his eyes. He
remained there and married Miss Metz. The Amana Colony people came
to America and lived at Buffalo, N.Y., but in 1854 moved to Iowa. Two
Lutheran Ministers are the founders of the Amana Colonies. They started
in Germany and Mrs. M. Hofer’s grandfather, Christ Metz, was the leader.
When they moved to Iowa a girl from Bon Homme Colony also joined the
Amanas.
When Bon Homme organized a second location, the Tripp Colony,
this new colony was able to borrow some money from the Amana Society.
***************

ARTICLES OF FAITH
The articles of faith of the Hutterites and the Mennonites were the same
with the exception of communistic living. Both coming from the

Anabaptists, both believing in baptism upon confession of faith, both
believing in the non-resistant doctrine, also not swearing but only affirm
and live a single life. From 1842 to 1870 the Hutterites lived as neighbors
with the Low German Mennonites. Low German teachers were teaching
the Hutterite children. Low German ministers were called to officiate at
occasions where a minister was needed. They started to use Low German
song books often called, The Luther Song Books, instead of using the old
Hutterite song books. This changing of song books and church customs
divided people. Conscience can be trained and with two different factions
confusion is caused.
***************

HUTTERITES ALL AMERICA
When the Hutterites arrived here in America some joined the colony and
some moved on private farms. The division was about 50-50. The division
was made by families. With Mennonite churches in East Freeman and at
Silver Lake, it helped them to feel more at home as far as church work was
concerned. They stayed independent churches until later some joined the
General Conference, some the K.M.B. Conference and others. At first
these independent Hutterites on the farm felt lonesome on the farm after
living in villages in Russia for many years. That was the social side of
their troubles. Some even talked about going back to Russia, but not one
left.
***************

NOT MANY SEE RUSSIA
Only very few Hutterites have seen Europe since they left there. Min. D.
M. Hofer and wife visited Russia when he was sent over to distribute food
in 1935. Min. M. Waldner of the Bon Homme Colony and Min. David
Hofer of James Valley, MB, visited Europe but not Russia. They visited
many places where the Hutterites spent their first 242 years in Austria,
Hungary, and other places, and met people that still speak the Hutterite
dialect. In 1870, Min. Michael. Waldner and Joseph Waldner of the Bon

Homme Colony went back to Russia on a mission to convince the
Hutterites still in Russia to join the Bon Homme Colony.
***************

LAST YEARS IN RUSSIA,
,We might also mention that during the last years in Russia teachers had to
be able to teach the Russian language besides the German. School age was
7 to 14 years. School term was 6 months. School had a very large
attendance and advanced scholars were used to assist the teacher.,
***************

IN 1879 ALL HERE
In 1879 the last Hutterites arrived from Russia and they were mostly from
Johannesruh and Hutterthal. The Hutterdorf people arrived here in 1874
and the New Hutterthal in 1875 with the exception of the 8 families
arriving here in 1874 and staying in Elkhart, Ind., over winter. At first
services were held in the homes.
The New Hutterthal Mennonite Church worship services in the years
of 1874 to 1888 were conducted in the homes. Ministers serving were:
Paul Tschetter 1874-1919, John D. Hofer 1884-1914, David J. Wipf 19101937, Paul J. Tschetter 1910-1945, Albert Ewert 1947 and is the present
minister in 1961.
The New Hutterthal Church also had the following members in the
Jim River. In the south, first was Min. David Gross and George Gross
south of Olivet, and north of Olivet Dave L. Tschetter, Paul Tschetter, Paul
J. Hofer, Min. Joseph Hofer, Andrew Wollman, Jacob Mendel, Martin
Waldner, John Tschetter, his father John Tschetter Sr., and John Decker
near Milltown. At first the Neu Hutterthal minister served them but later
they elected Min. Joseph Hofer for their minister. Min. Paul J. Tschetter
was elected minister in Russia when only 21 years old.

Salem K.M.B. Church was organized in 1884. Meetings were held at
Silver Lake Church Nov. 12, 1886, Dieterich Goosen and John Tschetter
were elected as ministers of the group, and meetings were held in a school
house. The following ministers were elected in course of time and served
gratuitously: Dieterich Goosen, John Tschetter, John Z. Kleinsasser, Jacob
J. Hofer, Joseph J. Glanzer Sr., Joseph W. Tschetter, David W. Tschetter,
Jacob I. Walter. These ministers served till 1952. Since then Min. J. J.
Kleinsasser served and is still serving at this time 1959.
The oldest church is the Hutterdorf Church. In the early days
Hutterdorf members held services south of Freeman and their ministers
were David Waldner and Min. Elias Wipf. Later all attended the
Hutterdorf Church west of Freeman. Min. P. J. Stahl was the last minister.
The first Hutterthal Church was located one mile south of the present
Hutterthal location. In 1898 a building was erected on the present location
by Zacharias Kleinsasser and Peter C. Kleinsasser as carpenters, and the
old building was moved on the Henry Adrian place near Silver Lake. The
first ministers of the Hutterthal Church, Min. John L. Wipf and Min. Paul
Hofer, both were elected in Johannesruh, Russia. The other two ministers
of the Hutterthal Church were Min. John Waldner, who came from
Hutterthal Russia in 1879, and Min. John Kleinsasser. He was also a
minister of the Hutterthal Church and sold his farm here to John Tschetter
and joined the colony. He died in New Elmspring Colony, Alberta, Canada.
Min. John Waldner joined the Jamesville Colony, but later left the colony
and died in Freeman.

THE SOCIAL PROBLEM
Living together so long made quite a melting pot and it took years for
those on the farm to separate from some of the customs. Those on the farm
still had the colony style of dress, the cooking was of the same order and
they speak the same dialect today. Some of the church customs were not
changed for many, many years, the custom of the congregation to rise

when the text was read, and kneel for prayer. For many years girls on the
farm were married to young men in the colony.
***************

THE SCHOOL PROBLEM
One big problem soon faced the Hutterites on the farm and that was the
school problem. At first they were teaching only German. Some of the
first teachers were:
Jacob Jeremias Wollman, John L. Hofer, Min. John L. Wipf, Min. John Z.
Kleinsasser and Paul Decker. These teachers were able to teach in German
language, but were not able to teach in the English language. The first
young men going away to attend college were: D. M. Hofer, Min. John
Kleinsasser, D. J. Mendel, Dr. A. A. Wipf, Druggist J. W. Wipf and others.
***************

SCHOOLS IN RUSSIA
In the old country they had parochial schools and taught Bible in school
and had no Sunday school. Here in the United States teaching Bible in the
Public School is against the law so Sunday Schools were organized some
60 years ago.
Some 60 years ago quite a number of young men attended different
colleges preparing for teaching because religion was not allowed in Public
Schools like in Russia. The Mennonite congregations in East Freeman,
West Freeman and Dolton had a meeting and started a drive to locate a
college in Freeman so that young people could prepare for the profession
of teaching here at home. This would save expense and keep the young
people under home influence, under the parental roof. West Freeman was
not much interested in this drive at first with the exception of Min. John L.
Wipf and D. J. Mendel. These two men took big interest right from the
start, and their field was West Freeman. When we think of the conditions
of the early days and the school question in those days, our heart is filled

with gratitude that we had men who visualized the future and realized the
necessity of opening a school, namely Freeman Junior College, an
institution that is accredited by the State since 1914. The school opened in
1902. The school, Freeman Junior College was not opened as a conference
school, and is not a conference school today.
The school was founded by the leaders of different Mennonite
Conferences in this part of the state and belongs to members of these
conferences. The Board Members are always of one of these Mennonite
Conferences, the General Conference, the Krimmer Mennonite
Conference, The Mennonite Brethren Conference, The E. M. B.
Conference, etc. Its an interdenominational institution. They found enough
common ground to make it such, and it belongs to the members of these
Conferences.
It’s an accredited institution and has prepared hundreds of young
people for their desired profession. Ex-students are in mission fields, in
the pulpits, in schoolrooms, and all kinds of church work. Teaching seems
to be a stepping stone to other professions in so many cases. Because of
this arrangement that it belongs to members of different conferences, the
smaller conference members feel more at home as members.
When we study the mission work of Freeman Junior College, it
makes us think of 1898 when we attended Augustana College in Sioux
Falls. In physical science we came to pages where science explains how
this world came into existence, “The Nebular Hypothesis.” It explains all
was vapor and gas, and started to rotate. Solids were formed, pieces flew
away, one was earth and the other pieces were the planets. Our teacher
said, “I believe this world was created the way the Bible tells us.” The
professor emphasized how important it is to have a teacher who believes
the Bible. Some time ago a mother called us and told us her daughter is
attending Freeman College and they have a book which talks about the
Nebular Hypothesis. This mother was disturbed about it, so I told her my
experience at Augustana College, and she saw how important it is to attend
a Christian School and have Christian teachers.
***************

SOME MOVE TO CANADA
Several years after the Freeman settlement was started some moved to
Canada to look for greener pastures. Those leaving first in 1888 were
Franz Wollman, near the Wolf Creek Colony, and his sons Andrew, Paul
and Joseph. His son Franz Wollman went to Russia in 1886 to get financial
help from his uncle, Mr. Wollman a millionaire, operating a factory under
the firm name of Lepp and Wollman. On his return Franz disappeared in
New York, said a report. His wife and three children joined the Wolf Creek
Colony.
In 1890 a second group left for Canada consisting of Mike Wollman, Mike
Wurz, and Jake Wurz.
In 1891 the third group moved to Canada consisting of Joseph J. Gross,
Joseph J. Walter, John Janzen, Josua Wollman, Jacob Walter, Wm. Janzen,
John S, Wipf, Jake Wurz, Min. David Waldner and sons John and David,
Andrew J. Kleinsasser and Henry Walter.
In 1895 Joseph Kleinsasser and Joseph Waldner moved to Canada.
In 1901 another group left for Canada, namely Andrew Stahl, Peter A.
Miller, George G. Waldner, Christ G. Waldner, Jacob Tschetter, Joseph J,
Waldner, Mike G. Waldner, Jake J. Wollman. They settled at Langham.
In 1902 another group left for Canada, namely Christ Wurz, Paul Decker,
Paul J. Waldner, Jake J. Waldner and Joseph J. Waldner and all settled at
Langham.
In 1904 the following moved to Langham, Canada, Paul A. Miller, Mrs.
Andrew Miller, A. A. Miller, John J. Hofer and Jacob G. Gross and his
sisters Mary and Rebecca.
In 1888 a group settled in Manitoba at first then moved to the Guernsey
country Sask.
The 1890 and 1891 group settled mostly at Yorkton, Canada. Later some
families moved to Langham from Yorkton. In all about 45 Hutterite

families then lived at Langham.
***************

SOME MOVED TO CHASELEY, N. DAK.
When the West Freeman settlement was about 25 years old. Young couples
found it hard to get a home of their own because land prices raised every
year. They looked for a new location and started a settlement at Chaseley,
North Dakota, in the latter 1890’s. Those locating were: Paul W. Tschetter,
Paul D. Wipf, Joseph J. Kleinsasser, Christ Kleinsasser, Jacob B. Hofer,
M. J. Hofer, Min. Paul F. Gross, and Wm. Kleinsasser. Not all came the
first year.
***************

BEADLE AND SPINK SETTLEMENT
This settlement was started in 1901 when David M. Waldner moved to a
farm in Spink County. In 1902 the first settlers from West Freeman located
in Beadle County, half a dozen families. The first settlers, all coming from
West Freeman were: Math E. Kleinsasser, Paul Stahl, Min. John Z. Wipf
and a few others. Soon many more sold out in West Freeman and moved to
Beadle to double and treble land acreage. Today its settlement of 30x30
miles, has nice churches in the country and several in Huron besides the
Huron Rescue Mission Station in Huron, founded by Min. Joe E. Wipf.
***************

DINUBA, CALIFORNIA SETTLEMENT
In 1909 several families in Beadle County moved to California and located
at Dinuba. Their leader was Min. John Z. Kleinsasser.,
***************

SULLY SETTLEMENT,

In 1919 a number of families moved from Beadle to Sully County and also
some from West Freeman.,
***************

MORA, MINNESOTA SETTLEMENT
In 1934 a small settlement was started at Mora, Minnesota by some
Beadle County families that left Beadle because of the drought years.
When the drought years were over they returned to Beadle.
***************

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
We said that the last Hutterite people arrived here in 1879. The migration
time was separation time for the Hutterite people. Those favoring colony
life joined a Colony and those favoring to live on private farms settled
down on farms. Whether on the farm or in the colony the big question now
was to foster a spirit of loyalty to their faith with the young generation.
The book “Martyr’s Mirror” “Martyrer Spiegel” was in many homes. This
book was written by Van Brecht in Holland and Peter Miller translated it
from the Dutch to German. Fifteen men, after fasting and prayer, worked
for three years to complete the work. Some 60 years ago this book was
sold in some Freeman stores and quite a number of the old folks in the
community had it. Mennonite History tells us there was a time when close
to 75 percent of the Mennonite denominations left the church because of
liberality and compromising with other movements. At first, the Hutterite
Churches on the farm existed as independent Mennonite denominations.
For many years now they have belonged to different Mennonite
conference but, mostly to General Conference and K.M.B. Conference. We
stated that at one time the Mennonite Church lost many members by
extreme liberality and compromising with other movements.

We are inclined to believe that the Hutterite Churches are facing that
situation now. Much of this is caused because they prepare for the ministry
and church work in schools that do not know anything about our heritage.
They come back with new ideas and customs. Conscience can be trained
and if training is in different directions there is no harmony, only
confusion. The Hutterite Mennonite belong to several different Mennonite
conferences. Let the young people prepare themselves in their respective
conference schools as much as possible.

The different Conferences have enough common ground to cooperate.
Freeman College is good proof. Members of five different Conferences
keep the institution on the map. Members of these different Conferences
serve on the Board of Directors. Personally the Mennonites believe in the
non-resistant doctrine. They believe you are personally doing the killing
and are responsible for the death. Other churches believe the state is doing
the killing and you are not responsible for the death. All churches believe
in the 6th Commandment, Thou Shall Not Kill.
***************

EAST FREEMAN
The East Freeman people came from Switzerland and when
persecuted moved to Austria near Russia. They stayed there only 7 years,
then moved to Russia and settled down in Poland, Russia, not very far
from the Hutterite Colony that had located in Russia in 1870, at
Wischenka. After suffering for generations, the Hutterites had now found a
place where they could enjoy religious liberty. The Swiss or East Freeman
people established a village Edurdsdorf. The second village was built at
Haridischa and the third at Waldheim in Poland. When compulsory
mandatory exemption was announced in Russia in 1773, that induced them
to move to Russia. When the exemption expired in 1873, they looked
towards America. Andrew Schrag went with a deputation as a delegate to
investigate. When Schrag returned with a favorable report preparations
were started to emigrate to America. The first 10 families left in 1874 and

arrived here in Yankton with Schrag as their leader. During the month of
August 1873 Daniel D. Unruh came with his family and a few others and
arrived in New York. Mr. Unruh was a native of Cremia, Russia, and a
member of the Mennonite Church. They came as far as Elkhart, Indiana.
He looked at land west of Menno. but he, with his group, decided to spend
the winter in Yankton. He later founded his home in Childstown for the
rest of his life.
***************

SILVER LAKE
The Silver Lake people, like the Hutterites and East Freeman people,
came from the Anabaptists. Their home was in Holland. Many years ago
we were presented with a book by the late Min. Henry P. Unruh, of Avon.
This book is a history of the Low German Mennonites of Silver Lake. This
book is a source of most of our information. We learned from this book
that the Low German forefathers came to the United States from Russia
but before coming to Russia they lived in Prussia, and before coming to
Prussia, Holland was their home. They belonged to the Anabaptists in
Holland. About 1580 they moved to Poland. King Sigermund welcomed
them and promised religious freedom. In Poland were many swamps and
they drained the low lands and their work of building up that country was
much appreciated. They liked it in Poland but after a war Poland was
divided. Russia took one third, Austria took one third and Prussia took one
third and that was where they lived. Their liberties were infringed upon
more and more and they faced many restrictions. Now they were not
allowed to preach their church services in Low German language from the
pulpit. They had to preach in High German Language. Their good days
ended. To get relief they sent delegates to Russia to see what inducements
they would be offered. These delegates returned with good news. Russia
offered each family 175 acres of land free from the government providing
no land would be sold without the consult of the government. They would
also be allowed to operate industries or factories and no war operation
would be allowed on their land and no saloons without consent. They
would be exempt from military service and soldiers would not be allowed
to quarter in the villages. They must keep roads and bridges in good shape.

In 1789 the first group of over 200 families arrived in South Russia from
Danzig, Prussia and started the Chorititz settlement adjoining Duieper
River. From 1803 to 1805 other groups arrived from Prussia, over 340
families. This new group established the Malotschna settlement on the
Malotschna River about 100 miles east of the Alt Kolonier settlement at
the River Duieper. The second group had more money but the first group
helped them just the same. All were prospering in their new localities. But,
the good days ended when the government withdrew their military
exemptions in 1873. A delegation of delegates, accompanied by others,
were sent to America. Among them were: Wm. Ewert, Jacob Buller,
Tobias Unruh, Jacob Peters, Henry Wiebe, Cor. Bour, Cor. Toews, David
Klassen and Leonard Schroeder. When the delegates returned they had
good news. They decided to move and the first ones arrived here in 1874
and started the Silver Lake settlement.
***************

TROUBLES OF ALL KINDS
After reading how much our forefathers had sacrificed for their
religious convictions we wonder how much our grandchildren would be
willing to sacrifice for their religious convictions. How many would
sooner sacrifice their home and their possessions acquired by the sweat of
their brow than their religious convictions? If not, who is responsible if
the heritage of their forefathers is not appreciated? Goethe, the poet says:
“Was du erbst von deinen Vätern erwerbes um es zu besitzen” (what you
inherit from your fore-fathers work diligently to possess it). The best
medium to accomplish this depends on the home, the church and the
school. Do not neglect these three institutions. Several years ago we
opened a Lutheran Church paper and we found on the first page a picture
that was instructive to us. There were three pictures on the page, a house, a
school building and a church. In front of the building a child was standing
and an inscription read, “These three institutions are responsible for this
child and the young generation.” Home, School, and Church are
responsible for our young generation and they can accomplish the most if
all three institutions co-operate. At the 100th Anniversary or the Missouri
Lutheran Synod in 1947 in Freeman, ample proof was produced to show

that their many Parochial Schools are the cause, to a great extent, for the
wonderful growth of the Synod during the past 100 years, The Hutterite
Colonies after 480 years, is proof that there is cooperation between home,
church, and school and the heritage of their forefathers is impressed
indelibly upon the young generation. The conscience is trained in the
younger years. How many revivals would have to be conducted to induce
young people to join the colonies? Colonies have no trouble, generally
speaking, keeping their young people in the Colony because they believe
it’s the place God wants them. How fortunate people are if they have faith
in God. When the Freeman people moved here from Russia they had faith
that Divine Providence would shape their destiny. Their delegates from
Russia to this country to find a location in 1873 had picked the Red River
Valley country in North Dakota. Unexpected developments brought them
to this locality here, with East Freeman and Silver Lake as neighbors.
Belonging to the same church and the whole community is a strong church
community and that means much. When the Christian Church was less
than 100 years old the enemies of the church were so loud in their claim
that the resurrection report was only a story, Jesus was carried away. A few
leaders of the Christian Church went to the office of the Emperor in Rome
and they found a letter which Pilate wrote to the Emperor and stated that
something had happened at Jerusalem that is beyond conception. We
crucified the man Jesus, we buried him, sealed the grave but, after a few
days he was again living and associated with his friends for 40 days. The
Pilot letter settled the question. Our generation is in danger today because
there are so many conflicting movements. Some say if my Conference
does it, it’s right. Some say break with your organized body and be
independent. Some are for a one church move, some for nondenominational. The Bible is the Word of God and is not changing.
Corrective actions are needed even in a Conference. We find in Mennonite
history there was a time when they lost more than half of their
membership and the cause was the conscience was trained in several
directions and resulted in confusion caused by all kinds of spiritual moves
they came in contact with. Today one big danger is to compromise with the
word on some questions.
People who study our troubles and crime wave claim this condition is
chargeable largely to the breakdown of the American home because the

home has less hold upon children than in any other generation of the past.
The reason for this is because children come in contact with outside
influence so much that this outside pressure wields a bigger influence on
the child than the influence by home.
The home, the church and the school are responsible for the child and
these three must co-operate. When our people lived in Russia the preacher,
as a rule, was the teacher. Bible history was studied in school but, when the
people arrived here they found it against the law to teach Bible in public
school. Sunday schools were started and some churches opened Parochial
schools and the people had confidence in Parochial schools even if they
had never attended one. Years ago a man representing the Chicago Herald
arrived in Freeman to look for a boy to sell papers. We told him we did not
know the boys in town but, he should call on the teachers of our two
schools, the Public School and the Parochial school. “Well,” he said, “if
you have a Parochial school that is the place where I will call on the
teachers. The boys in that school all come from Christian homes generally
speaking and I have confidence in them, and will go and see them.”
The East Freeman people, the Silver Lake people and the West
Freeman people always co-operated on different undertakings. When some
of them moved to Freeman these three churches felt responsible for these
Freeman people and every Sunday a minister of one of the three churches
spoke. They had no church building and had services in a school and other
places. In the course of time they decided to build a church in Freeman.
The following people met to discuss the question of a church building:
George Gross, A. Gering, Paul R. M. Hofer, A. D. Schmidt, John Borman,
John W. Tschetter, Sam Walter, Jake M. Wollman, Joe C. Graber, Joe A.
Miller, Joe L. Wipf and Jake J. Graber. They elected a committee of 5
trustees, namely: A. Gering as Chairman: Jacob M. Wollman as Secretary,
Sam Walter as Treasurer, George Gross and John Borman.
The present site was bought from A. Gering at $15.00 and a building
was erected in 1898. The three carpenters were: Joseph C. Gross, Peter C.
and Zacharias Kleinsasser donated labor. The amount of $2,000.00 had
been accumulated and it was decided to build. The size was 28 feet wide,
48 feet long. John Schroeder of Dolton was the contractor to take charge of

the construction with the brethren donating their labor. The building was
completed the same summer and dedicated with Min. Christian Kaufman
and Min. Christian Mueller in charge. These two ministers with Joseph
Kaufman and John L. Wipf occupied its pulpit until joined in 1902 by
Min. H. A. Bachman, who came to Freeman to assume his duties at the
new college.
Min. Wm. Unrau is the present minister in 1961. They have a new
church building which was dedicated May 11 1952 and a new parsonage
was erected in 1953.

THINGS OF INTEREST
Be sure to read this it you are interested in East Freeman and Silver
Lake and West Freeman. These three groups have many things in common,
like Freeman College, Home for Aged, M.C.C. Work, etc. East Freeman
people came originally from Switzerland. Because of their persecution
they moved from Switzerland to Austria in 1790 but the new location was
not liked so they moved from Austria to South Russia in 1797. The Silver
Lake people come originally from Holland. Persecution caused the move
to Poland in 1580, where King Siegmund welcomed them and they
enjoyed religious freedom for many years. Later this locality became part
of Prussia and in the course of time their rights were infringed upon. They
were not allowed to preach in Low German dialect. They had to use the
High German language in the pulpit and they met other infringements. In
1789 the first group of 200 families moved to Russia and started the
Molotschna settlement in South Russia. The West Freeman people came
from almost every nationality in Europe but organized their first Hutterite
Colony in 1528 in Austria. They moved to Russia in 1770 and settled down
at first in North Russia, but in 1842 moved to South Russia. These three
groups emigrated to America in the 1870’s. They were always in contact
with each other because all three groups came from the Anabaptist move.
The trouble of the Low Germans in Poland started in 1772, when after a
war Poland was divided, part of it was annexed to Austria some to Russia,
some to Prussia.

“The 17 branches of Mennonites have a membership of over 125,000.
Until about 50 years ago there were no college or university men in
Mennonite pulpits.” -Dr. J. E. Hartzler.

——————o——————

We say on another page that circumstantial developments caused us
to write this short history, but we feel we ought to be more specific. It was
in 1914 when my wife’s father was on his deathbed and we visited him.
Banker Anderson of Bridgewater happened to be there and told us he had
asked so many of our people about our early history but not one could give
him an answer. So we told him a short history of the Hutterites. Grandpa
told my Mrs. to hand us that short Hutterite history book written by his
sister’s husband Min. Jacob Wipf in 1840 and it was presented to him
before he died. Min. Wipf and Min. Peter Hofer started the Elmspring
Colony in 1877. He wrote this short history in the early 1840’s. The
Hutterites moved from North Russia to South Russia in 1842. The village
had sent this Wipf and Peter Gross to a high school in a Low German
village so our village could have their own teachers instead of getting one
from the Low Germans.
Our new comers met trouble they never expected and that was the
language question. They were all German, but made an effort from the
time they arrived to learn the English language. The changing of language
in the home and church made them meet many unpleasant conditions. It’s
only several years ago that they changed the English language in church.
Many a grandmother cannot talk to her grandchild because some
grandchildren cannot speak German. Our own experience is quite a lesson

to us. We have published all English papers since June 1st, 1902, and in
business and politics we prefer to use the English language but, when it
comes to the Bible we are thinking in the German language. The many
verses we memorized in our younger days and Bible History all was in the
German language. There is such a thing as thinking in a language.

MENNO SIMONS
Menno Simons joined the Mennonite group in Holland 11 years after
the first church was organized in Zurich, Switzerland in 1825. He was a
Catholic Priest, but when he joined the Mennonites he became a leader and
those with him were called Mennonites. Just like when Jacob Hutter joined
the colony, two years after the colony was founded they called them
Hutterites because he became their leader.

MORE THINGS OF INTEREST
When the old timers came from Russia they appealed for Divine help
and had the faith that Providence would guide their destinies. They had
faith in God who can raise the dead, calm the storms, stop sun and moon
from moving, can make lions live with sheep and can conquer giants. The
Hutterite delegates selected the Red River Valley in North Dakota for the
settlement but circumstantial developments brought them here close to
East Freeman and Silver Lake people.

We have three original colonies in the United States, Bon Homme
established in 1874, Wolf Creek established in 1874, Elm Spring
established in 1877. Each one of these three original colonies and its
branches belong to one Conference, the Bon Homme Conference, the Wolf
Creek Conference and the Elm Spring Conference. In 1950 when this
report was made Wolf Creek had 26 branch colonies, Elmspring 24 and
Bon Homme 38, nearly all located in Canada. When they moved to Canada
Wolf Creek and Elm Spring Colonies located in Alberta and the Bon
Homme Colonies located in Manitoba.
Today (2007) Bon Homme (also known as Schmiedeleut) have branched to
178. Wolf Creek (the Dariusleut) have 153 colonies and Elm Spring (the
Lehrerleut) have 134 colonies. All have colonies in Canada and USA.

A report taken in 1904 of the three original Hutterite Colonies, Wolf
Creek, Bon Homme, and Elmspring gives them as owners of 320 quarter
sections of land, 242 families, 36,000 head of cattle, 10,700 sheep. They
lived in 12 colonies. In 1950 another report was taken and over 80 colonies
were reported. Wolf Creek had increased to 20 colonies, Elmspring to 24
colonies, and Bon Homme to 38 colonies. All the colonies settling in
Alberta, Canada were from Wolf Creek and Elm Spring. All the colonies
settling in Manitoba were from Bon Homme. Our three original Hutterite
Colonies kept on spreading out and today (2007) we have appro. 500
Hutterite Colonies in Canada and the United States.

Remember the birthday of the Christian Church was at Pentecost and
the New Testament Days began in Palestine. The Church of Christ is the
Salvation institution, the Guardian Tutor in the Holy Spirit, the Word of

God is the medium. So many Christians died as martyrs for their faith.
One Bishop of the Catholic Church was in Rome and one in
Constantinople. About 500 A.D. the Bishop in Constantinople had a big
mission field in Austria and gained a large membership. It became a
question whether this new field should belong to Rome too and resulted in
a split. After that we had the Greek Catholic Church and the Roman
Catholic Church. The Greek spread into Russia.

school in the 1880’s all she needed was a plain dress and shawl, and
wooden shoes and stockings. Today’s style is toeless shoes, anklets, etc.

——————o——————

The Rappish Colony in Pa., was very good to the Hutterites and
advanced them $4,000.00 for a start when they arrived from Russia.

——————o——————

So far the oldest Hutterite on record was 103 years. He was Michael
R. Hofer and he died in 1932. Paul Mandel was next. He died at the Elm
Spring Colony, age 99 years and 9 months. Mrs. Christian Waldner died in
Alberta, Canada in 1955 at the age of 99 years.
Peter Entz from Waldeck Colony, SK lived from Sept. 21, 1897 to
Apr. 23, 2000.

——————o——————

The Hutterites had one millionaire, Andrew Wollman in Russia. He
made the money in the Lepp and Wollman Factory. He was married to
Miss Lepp.

——————o——————

The Hutterites prospered for a time in Moravia and Hungary. They
had some 50 colonies with a population close to 15,000 people. The
colonies were prosperous, filled prominent positions and had good
schools. When prosecutions started they left the country and not even 100
entered Russia at first but, some came later.

——————o——————

To show you how strict and particular people were with their children
in the old country village listen to this. “Gluecksthal with population of
2000 people, they had one Reformed and one Lutheran Church and the
churches were always on very friendly terms. The young people had to
attend Sunday school until they were 20 years old. If one missed Sunday
school he had to pay 5c fine. If that fine was not paid by the time he was
married the minister was not allowed to marry him. All people had to
attend church services on Sunday. Church members were not allowed to
attend Markets on Sunday, but were expected to visit the neighbors and
friends. In case an article was stolen and the party that stole it was
discovered, the party with the stolen article had to carry it through the
street, hold it up high and stop at every crossing for a while. The Schultz,
(Mayor) and the school children marched along with the offender. At every
crossing where they stopped the Mayor made a short speech telling the
children how important it was to live right and be obedient to home,
church and school. At the end of the march the offender received five
lashes on the back. All this left an indelible impression on the children
who saw it. A performance like that in our country would decrease the
crime wave. People who make it a study claim reaction of children to
pictures is about 8 times greater to children than to adults. That gives
movies and TV a great responsibility.

——————o——————

When the Hutterites lived in Russia the village sent two young men,
Jacob Wipf and Peter Gross, to the Halbstadt High School to prepare for
teaching. That is why the Elm spring Colony was always called Lehrerleut
(Teacher People). He was the founder of the Elm Spring Colony in 1877

and was very prominent, not only with the colonies, but also outside. He
wrote a short history of the Hutterites when still in Russia in 1842 and we
are in possession of this book.

——————o——————

Washington and Jefferson, our early Presidents of the United States,
said they wish we would never have any large cities because it’s easier to
raise a clean family in the country. Our forefathers lived on a farm, but
when land became scarce some moved to town but, the church did not like
to see them move to town.

——————o——————

When they came to America, Hutterite leaders asked President Grant
for military exemption and he told them all are exempt from military
service in the United States who have conscientious scruple against killing
in war and are exempt in this country not only for 100 years but always.
And it’s a fact the government has been very considerate of the conscience
of religious minority group.

——————o——————

Conscience can be trained. In the early days nobody would dare to
pray unless hands were folded. In church service people knelt for praying,
when the text was read all rose, but they did not rise when the benediction

was said. Church history reports the first Christians were standing when
praying in church to be closer to God above.

——————o——————
In the early days Bible names were given to new arrivals but today
most any name is given new babies. Or at least a German name such as
Frederick, Gretal etc…
——————o——————

The first Mennonite settlement in the United States was established
in 1662 in Delaware but they were not welcome by the other settlers and
left the place. The first permanent settlement by Mennonites was located
at Germantown, Pa., in 1683 where 13 families settled. Here they came in
contact with the Quakers and conducted church services together. This
happened where the present Philadelphia is located. Here is where the first
protest against slavery was presented to the government signed by three
Mennonites and several Quakers in 1688.

——————o——————

When the West Freeman people left Russia and emigrated to America
a few remained in Russia like the Millionaire Wollman family, a Stahl
family and others. Their children and grandchildren met a lot of trouble
when Russia turned over to the Communists. We have a letter from two
sisters who are now in Canada. They are distantly related to us. Their
grandmother was an aunt to our mother. We received a letter from them
and it breaks your heart what they write. Their grandmother, Barbara
Tschetter, was married to Mr. Unger. Barbara was a sister to the father of

the late Paul J. Tschetter who served the Neu Hutterthal church as elder for
about 50 years. Another brother of Barbara is Peter Tschetter who is the
founder of the Tschetter Colony and another brother was John Tschetter,
who lived a half mile east of the Tschetter Colony.

THINGS OF INTEREST TO THOSE INTERESTED
German people prospered in Russia and became autocratic. They
looked down upon the Russian people. That is why no intermarriages were
reported.

——————o——————
When the first East Freeman, West Freeman and Silver Lake people
arrived here in Yankton in 1874 a charter of about 25 frame buildings and
shacks was all that you could find in the Mother City of Yankton, yet it
was the State Capitol. Many houses were built of sod. Houses, Schools and
Churches were kept warm by Buffalo chips or twisted hay. Ox team was
used for traveling in a sled or wagon. Farmers in those days were
neighborly and helped each other.

——————o——————

Jacob Knels died in the Yankton State Hospital. He was born in 1862
and died in 1942. He was a promising young man. Jacob was baptized
March 21, 1880 and was a member of the Neu Hutterthal Church. In 1884

a cyclone passed their place when he was plowing and the fright caused
mental derangement. He was taken to the State Hospitat where he died
January 26, 1942.

***************

EARLY DAYS PLOWING
The people worked very hard. Most work was done by hand with not
much machinery. They had very far to go to a railroad town. The nearest
town was Yankton. Women often walked to Yankton with a basket of eggs
to buy groceries and returned home the next day, a 30 mile trip.

——————o——————

Jacob Graber Post hauled mail from Yankton to Silver Lake in 1870
to 1878 at $200.00 a year. Two trips a week were made with one horse and
a buggy.

——————o——————

Wm. Kleinsasser bought the Freeman Livery barn from Jake Weber in
1896 and sold it to Jake Weber in 1898 and moved back to North Dakota.

——————o——————

When the two delegates were sent by the Hutterite people to America
to look for a location in 1873 they met Mennonite people over east who
complained that they commence to use the English language more or less
in the church. Our delegates said that would never happen with our people.
We will stick to the German language. But they were poor judges. The
sermons in every West Freeman church are in English language every
Sunday because so many of the young generation cannot understand
German. However, the colony churches are still in German.

The following are Elders for Canada Colonies; Prediger Peter Hofer,

——————o——————

The Hutterites knew the back ground of the families and that guided
them when electing a minister. A minister must be liberal and not stubborn
and careful when electing their officers.

——————o——————
Of all those who emigrated from Russia to America, only one died on
the way and was buried in Bremen, Germay. He was a brother to the late
David L. Tschetter here.

Min. J. M. Tschetter’s first wife was the first Hutterite child born in
America.

On Dec 11, 1874, Anna, the daughter of Joseph Waldner and Anna
(Kleinsasser) is believed to be the first child born at Bon Homme Colony,
SD. Her parents left Milltown Colony in 1894. In 1918, Anna also left
from James Valley Colony, SD with her husband Michael Waldner “Mitsch
Michel” and their children.

OLD TIME MUD HOUSE
When the pioneers arrived here from Russia in the 1870’s nobody
dreamed of a modern house. They erected a mud house like the one above.
One end was used for a house, the other end was used for a barn. The mud
walls were more than two feet thick. They had a mud oven about seven
feet long and a stove room about 10x10 feet at the bottom tapering to a
outlet on the roof about 2x2 feet. All houses had the same plan. One end
had two rooms, a large and a small. !n the center a hall and the kitchen and
the other end had a room, then a 3 foot walk out in the barn, then the
pantry room. The oven was heated with straw, hay or manure and later at
some places they used wood. Their Grandchildren today use oil furnaces
that regulate themselves. All you need today is to set the thermostat at 75
degrees or whatever temperature you want. If the temperature gets below
75 degrees it will start alone and when it gets up to 75 it will stop.

To get an idea what father and mother went through, read about Mr.
David Kleinsasser. He farmed on the 160 acres that is now part of
Freeman. The north east quarter of that section. He died in 1879 and Mrs.
Kleinsasser, who was the mother of Mrs. John K. Hofer, then homesteaded
on that quarter. She planted 3 acres of flax which was sown by hand. The
yield was 8 bushels per acre and when ripe was pulled out and threshed
with a hand flail. The whole crop was sold for $20.00. Today this would
not even pay for an auto license, but at that time many little necessities for
life were bought. We might also mention that Mrs. Kleinsasser was later
married to George Gross in 1881. He died in 1894 and her third husband
was Min. John L. Wipf and he died in 1922.

HUTTERITE COs GAVE UP THEIR LIVES FOR GOD
These are the graves of brothers Joseph and Michael Hofer, members of
the Rockport Hutterite Colony who gave up their lives at the hands of the
state for their faith in a God who abhors violence, particularly the taking
of other human lives.
Their story, recounted widely in some circles, especially in the years
immediately following World War I, is disheartingly similar to the
countless others which comprise a significant part of Anabaptist history. A
third brother, David, who endured the same treatment as Joseph and
Michael, later recorded the accounts of their persecution, as have several
historians.
In the spring of 1918, four members of Rockport Colony were
drafted: brothers Joseph, Michael and David, and Jacob Wipf, a brotherin-law. They were inducted into the U.S. Army at Camp Lewis, Wash., on
May 25. While on the train from South Dakota to Washington the other
recruits jeered the Hutterites, even cutting their beards and hair.
At Camp Lewis they refused to sign a card promising obedience to
military commands, refused to fall in with their platoon and refused to
wear their military uniforms. All four were court-martialed on June 10 and
sentenced to 37 years in prison, later reduced to 20.
The four were incarcerated at Alcatraz, the island federal prison in
San Franrisco Bay where they were placed in the dungeon’s solitary cells.
For the first four days they received no food and only a glass of water
every 24 hours. Because they still refused to wear the military uniforms,

they were clothed only in their underwear. They slept on the cold, wet
concrete floor without blankets.
They spent the last 36 hours in the dungeon “strung up” — their
hands manacled so high to the bars that they could barely touch the floor.
By the time they were released on the fifth day, the men were
suffering from scurvy and covered with insect bites. Their arms were so
swollen they could not get the sleeves of their jackets over them.
For the rest of their time in Alcatraz they experienced regular
beatings, including one by the prison chaplain — and were allowed into
the prison yard only for an hour every Sunday.
This treatment continued despite an Oct. 10, 1917, memo from the
Adjutant General of the Military to all camp commanders instructing that
conscientious objectors be treated with “tact and consideration.”
In letters home, David Hofer repeatedly assured their families that
they were well. While their physical status may be questioned, his letters
leave little doubt about their spiritual health. He repeatedly mentioned the
honor of being chosen to suffer for God.
He promised us, his children, that he will be with us till the end,
David wrote his wife and children. “Let us be in good confidence to him,
and fall on our knees and pray that he shall give us power to stand for what
we have promised.”
In late November the four men were transferred from Alcatraz to Fort
Leavenworth, Kan. After four days and five nights of travel, they arrived
at Leavenworth at 11 p.m. and, chained together and carrying their
luggage, herded up the hill to the prison, all the while prodded by
bayonets.
By the time they reached the prison gate they were drenched in sweat,
despite the raw, wintry weather. They were then forced to stand outside in
their underwear until 1 a.m. All four were roused at 5 a.m. to stand again
outside.

In the morning Joseph and Michael complained of chest pains and
were immediately hospitalized. Meanwhile, Jacob Wipf and David Hofer
were sent to solitary confinement for refusing to work in the prison.
When Joseph and Michael fell ill, Wipf sent a telegram home to their
wives, who immediately took the train to Kansas. They were delayed a day
when they were accidentally sent to Fort Riley. By the time they arrived
late at night, both Joseph and Michael were near death. When the wives
returned, the next day Nov. 29, Joseph had died. His wife discovered his
body prepared and laid in the casket, dressed in the military uniform
Joseph had refused to wear while alive.
Michael died Dec. 2 with his father at his side. His last words were,
“Come Lord Jesus, into thy hands I commend my spirit.” Joseph Hofer
was 24 years old and left his wife and two children, ages 2 1/2 and 1.
Michael was 25 and left his wife and a daughter less than a year old.
Their deaths helped precipitate many of the Hutterite colonies
moving to Canada.

HUTTERITE NAMES
Tschetter - (Czeterle, Zetterle) - This name is recorded in Hutterite history
as far back as 1760 when Abraham Tschetter, at Sabostiste, Hungary was
arrested for opposing the government church. He was taken fifty miles
away to the town of Erlau where he was imprisoned in a convent with the
Jesuits. He gave up the faith and became a Catholic. Lorenz Tschetter was
arrested in 1766, imprisoned for one year because of his faith. He rejoined
the Bruderhof at Walachia upon his release and from there to Russia.
Those with this name were among the families coming to America in
1874. The Tschetter name carries on from these and is found in Dariusleut,
Schmiedleut and the Prairieleut of America.

Waldner - (Waltner) - A Hutterite family name coming from Amiach,
Carinthia, Austria in 1756. Jerg Waldner, his wife Anna and their three
children, Christian, Johannes and Maria fled to Transylvania in 1755.
There they joined the Hutterites where John was chosen preacher and is
the chronicler of the Klein Geschichtscbuch. Johann’s son Andreas
married Kathrina Schrag from a nearby Swiss Mennonite village in 1797.
Upon Andreas death his wife Kathrina took her six children back to join
the Swiss group. From Transylvania they moved to Walchis and later to
Russia. They took the name Waltner, which is common among the Swiss
Mennonites in Kansas, and South Dakota. Michael Waldner established the
Bon Homme Colony at Tabor, South Dakota in 1874. Waldner is common
among the Brotherhoods and the Prairieleut of today.

Kleinsasser - A common Hutterite name originated from Amiach,
Carinthia, Austria. Johann Kleinsasser was leader of the group of
Lutherans expelled from Carinthia and who fled to Transylvania, under the
leadership of Maria Theresa. In 1755, this group went to Alwinz where
they joined the Hutterites. With Johann Kleinsasser were his wife Barbara,
a daughter Christina, and his brothers Stephanus, and Mathias and Joseph.
In 1763 Johann was ordained the leader of the Hutterites. This name is
very common among the Brotherhood and the Prairieleut today.

Fast - Through inter-marriage this Mennonite name from a Low German
village came into the Hutterites.

Knels - A name first seen in the Hutterites in 1783 when a widow Lisel
Knels and her two sons Abraham and Johannes joined at Wischink, Russia,
coming from the Low German Mennonite village of Franztal in East
Prussia. This name is almost extinct today with only two families of the
name in the Brotherhood in 1958.

Glanzer - A family name from Carinthia. They were expelled because of
their refusal to accept the Catholic faith and taken to Transylvania.
Christian Glanzer and family settled in Romos, a village west of
Hemianstadt. In 1755 they joined the colony with the group that went to
Alwinz. They came to the United States in 1874 and since that time there
are many Glanzers among the Schmiedleut and the Prairieleut today.

Hofer - A name that originates in Carinthia, Austria where they were
staunch Lutherans. Ulrich Hofer was chosen steward of the Hutterian
Brethren in 1542,. This was the first time the Hofer name was mentioned
among the Hutterites. Around 1750 the country demanded the Catholic
religion; therefore many people were driven from their homes and fled to
Transylvania where they met with the Hutterites. Among these were
Michael and Mathias Hofer from Amiach and their brother Johannes Hofer
of St. Petersburg with his wife, Anna, and their seven children, Johannes,
Michael, Christian, Paul, Jacob, Anna, and Barbara. All the Hofers in the
Brotherhood and Prairieleut derive from these Hofers.

Gross - A German name possibly from Austria Tirol. Jacob Gross, (Jacob
von Waldschut) a furrier from South Germany was a very successful
Anabaptist leader in 1525. On September 15,1527 he was seized with Hans
Hut at an Anabaptist meeting in Augsburg. After being imprisoned for
almost four years he recanted on June 22, 1537. The name was recorded in
1528 during the early Anabaptist movement, first appearing among the
Hutterites in 1782 when Andreas Gross, his wife Christina, and son Jerg
came to the group. Christina and Jerg accepted the faith and were baptized.
Jerg is the ancestor of all the Grosses in the Brotherhood and the
Prairieleut in America and Canada.

Decker - (Dekker) - A Mennonite and Hutterite name of old Flemish
background in West Prussia. It was first mentioned in Schonse in 1695.
From there it spread to Poland and Russia. In 1783, a group of 15
Mennonites from a Low German village joined the Hutterites at Wischink,
Russia. Among them were Elsie Dekker, a widow with her five children,
Hein, Jacob, Heinrich, Benjamin, and Eva. The name Decker, is carried on
from the descendants of Benjamin to America and Canada and is found
among the Lehrerleut, Schmiedleut and the Prairieleut. When the first
Hutterite Brethren began their emigration to the United States in 1874, a
John Decker is named among the first group to leave Russia. These people
settled in Dakota and established the Bon Homme Colony, the first
Hutterite Bruderhof in America.

Jansen - A Mennonite name that came into the Hutterites through intermarriage with the Low Germans in Russia.

Mendel - (Maendel, Mandel, Maendelig) - In 1529, Jacob Mendel was
“Diener der Notdurft” with the Hutterian Brethren formerly administrator
of the Lord of Lichtenstein at Nicholsburg, Moravia. His birthplace is
unknown. Hans Mendel died a martyrs death in 1560. He was bound to a
ladder and thrown into the flames. He was from Tryol, the village of
Albuns near Gufidaun. Among the group from Sabatich to Wischiok in
Russia was Paul Maendelig of Czech origin. He became the ancestor of the
Mendels of today in the Lehrerleut, the Schmiedleut and the Prairieleut.

Miller - (Muller) - A common Mennonite name. A Peter Muller and
Joseph Muller with his wife Elizabeth and two children, Joseph and
Barbara were among the Lutherans who fled to Transylvania from UnterAmlach, Carinthia, Austria. Miller descendants are found among the
Prairieleut in America.

Pollman - Pullman (Polman, Bolman) - In 1784, with a group coming from
Sabatisch and Lebarto join the Hutterites at Wischink, Russia were Tobias
Bolman and wife Susanna (son-in-law of Jacob Walther) and Andreas
Bolman with his wife Roesel and six children: Johannes, Adam, Maria,
Barbel, Kathrina and Eva. Joseph Bolman and his wife Judith and children,
Lisel. Mariela, Annele also joined this group. This name is common
among the Prairieleut of America, but not found in the Brotherhood.

Stahl - A Hutterite name that first appeared in 1663 when a Johannes Stahl
was taken prisoner at Zobelhof, Hungary by the invading Turks. In 1757,
another Johann Stahl with his wife and four children is mentioned, at
Alwinz, Transylvania. After this the name is common among the
Hutterites and is found among the Dariusleut, the Schmiedleut, and the
Prairieleut of America.

Walter - (Walther) - The oldest Hutterite family name in existence today.
The earliest Anabaptist member of the family was Franz Walther, a
barber-surgeon from near Maulbronn, Wurttemberg who joined the
Hutterites in 1580. He was chosen Diener des Worts in 1597 at Pribitz,
Moravia. In 1746 Zacharias Walther was chosen elder of the Hutterites,
but was imprisoned for his faith. Later he joined the Catholic State
Church. His only son Jacob immigrated to the Ukraine from Sabatish,
Hungary, with his wife Kathrina and two sons Jacob and Darius in 1784. In
1874 Preacher Darius Walter came from Russia with several families and
established the Wolf Creek Colony ten miles west of Freeman, South
Dakota. All the Walters in the Dariusleut and Prairieleut are descendants.

Wollman - (Walemann, Woleman) - The name of Hans Waleman is
mentioned in the Klein Geschechtsbuch during the 30 years war. Later
Jacob Waleman from Sabatisch, Hungary, with his wife Asseneth and five
children, Andreas, Michael, Barbel, Judith, Asseneth and a Katherina
Waleman and her two children Joseph and Gretel are listed as joining the

colony, at Wischink, Russia in 1784. They were with the Brethren when
they came to America. The descendants are found among the
Schmiedeleut, the Dariusleut, and the Prairieleut.

Wurz - (Wurtz) - A family name among the Hutterite Brethren for over
400 years. Joseph Wurtz was chosen as preacher in 1611 at Neumuhl,
Moravia, Austria. In 1650 Moses Wurtz was chosen preacher at Sabatisch
in Hungary. In 1755 Andreas Wurz from St. Peter and his wife Margreta
and five children, Christian, Elizabeth, Magdalena, Christina and Anna
joined the Hutterites at Alwinz and Rreuz, and the Prairieleut in America
and Canada all come from Andreas Wurz

Wipf - Michael Wipf was Elder, or head preacher, at Alwinz, Transylvania
from 1694 to 1717. The Wipf family name has been among the Hutterite
Brethren since this time. They came to the United States in 1874.

Tschetter
Tschetter, also spelled Czeterle and Zetterle, is a Hutterite family name. In
1760 Abraham Tschetter at Sobotiste, Hungary, vigorously opposed a
Jesuit who had been sent by the government to catholicize the Hutterian
Brethren and who was preaching in their meeting-house. Tschetter was
soon arrested and taken to Erlau, about 50 miles from the Bruderhof, and
imprisoned in the Jesuit Monastery prison. Here he gave up his faith and
became Catholic. Lorenz Tschetter was imprisoned in 1766 at Alwine,
Hungary, for his faith. Upon his release in 1767 he went to Walachia with
the rest of the Bruderhof, and from there to Russia, where the family
increased. Paul and Lorentz Tschetter were among the twelve delegates
from several Mennonite branches in Russia who came to (he United States
and Canada in 1873 to look for land and in 1874 led some 40 families to
Dakota. Paul Tschetter became a leader of the group that joined the K.M.B.

Church. His son J.W. Tschetter was long a K.M.B. city missionary in
Chicago.
In 1957 five Tschetters were serving as head preachers in Hutterite
Bruderhofs of the Dariusleut, vis., Paul J. Tschetter of the Thompson
Bruderhof, Christian Tschetter of the Husher (Rosebud) Bruderhof, Jacob
Tschetter of the Howl Ranch (Tschetter) Bruderhof, Lorentz R. Tschetter of
the Riverside Bruderhof, and Peter S. Tschetter of the Holt Bruderhof.
There were also four Tschetter ministers in the G.C.M. group, among them
P.P. Tschetter of Kingman, Kansas

Paul Tschetter
Paul Tschetter (1842 - 1919), was born in Blumenort, Molotschna, South
Russia. He became a member of the Hutterian Brethren in 1860. In that
year he was married to Maria Walter. Five sons and five daughters were
born to this union, among whom was Joseph W. Tschetter, for many years
a minister of the Krimmer Mennonite Brethren in Chicago. In 1866 he was
ordained to the ministry and in 1883 to the office of elder. He is buried in
the Neuhutterthal cemetery, located 45 miles northwest of Yankton, S.D.,
on the homestead which he too came to in America. In 1873 Tschetter was
a member of the delegation sent to St. Petersburg in the matter of
continued exemption from military service. Because the answer was not
satisfactory a delegation of twelve Mennonites and Hutterites visited the
American frontier in 1873 to investigate the possibilities of emigration.
Among the twelve were Paul Tschetter and his uncle Lorenz Tschetter,
both of Hutterthal. Tschetter appeared before President Grant to plead for
exemption from military service for his people who were to settle in
America. The diary of his deputation journey to America in 1873 presents
a keen analysis of the work and observations of the Russian delegation. In
1874 Tschetter brought his family to America and settled in South Dakota.
He never lived in a Bruderhof and thus did not practice the Christian
Communism of the Hutterian Brethren. He was a leader in the group which
joined the Krimmer Mennonite Brethren Conference.

Waldner
Waldner (Waltner), a Hutterite family name stemming from Aemlach,
Carinthia, Austria. Jorgen Waldner was one of the Lutheran Carinthia
exiles who was expelled to Hungary in 1755 because he refused to accept
Catholicism. He was sent to Transylvania, and there united with the
Hutterian Brethren at Alwinz. His son Johannes Waldner, a preacher, was
the chronicler of the Klein- Geschichtbuch. He died in Russia on Dec. 14,
1824. During this time the Hutterites abandoned their practice of
community of goods. Michael Waldner, also a preacher, reinstituted
community of goods in 1859, and joined the emigration to the United
States in 1874, where they established the first American Bruderhof at Bon
Homme, 20 miles west of Yankton, S.D. The name is now found in the
Hutterite communities in South Dakota, Montana, Alberta, and Manitoba.
There are 34 Hutterite ministers with this name. The name, as found in the
General Conference Mennonite Church, (Waltner) is of Mennonite origin.
Erland Waltner is president of Mennonite Biblical Seminary, Elkhart, Ind.,
and Lena Waltner is instructor in an at Bethel College. Harris Waltner and
James Waltner are G.C.M. pastors in Kansas.

Waldner, Christian, chosen to the Hutterian Brethren ministry June 26,
1898, and confirmed by Darius Walter in Canada. After the death of Elias
Walter he became the elder of the Dariusleut, living in the West Raley
Bruderhof in Canada. He died Feb. 23, 1937.

Waldner, Johannes (1749-1824), born near Villach, Carinthia, of Lutheran
parents, with whom he migrated on the order of Empress Maria Theresa to
Transylvania in 1755, along with other Lutherans. Here the entire
Carinthians exile group turned Hutterite and became the very soul of a
revitalization of the brotherhood. In his later years he wrote his
recollections, called Denkwürdigkeiten, as a sort of continuation of the old
Hutterite chronicle, the Geschicht-Buch. Thus grew a remarkable new
book, the Klein-Geschichtsbuch der Hutterischen Bruder (first printed in
1947). Waldner wrote the story only to the year 1802; the remainder to

1947 was done by other writers. In this work he mentioned his own
experiences at different places.
In 1767 Waldner shared the dramatic flight of the brotherhood across
the mountains into Romania (Walachia) and all their subsequent hardships
until the Brethren found a new home in Ukraine, first in Vishenka, later in
Radichev. In 1782 he was elected preacher, and in 1794 bishop of the
entire brotherhood. In 1818 an unfortunate conflict arose as one group
wished to give up the principle of community goods. Waldner insisted on
continuing this time-honored principle in spite of all external difficulties.
“I would rather die at the stake than to abandon the old practice”. Thus a
split occurred and Waldner moved to a new place near by called Neudorf.
In 1824 he died at the age of 75.
Waldner began writing his Denkwürdigketen in 1793, but he prefaced
this personal story by a brief recapitulation of Hutterite history as found in
the larger chronicle and amplified it by records otherwise unknown. This
resulted in a brilliant history of the Hutterites, more condensed than the
older (Britmichel) chronicle, and yet full and rich. Johann Loserth, who
read this work for the first time ca. 1930, considered Waldner an
outstanding historian, with a unique skill in making events live.
This revival of the interest in history was only secondary to
Waldner’s more central achievements. His main concern was the revival of
the old and genuine spirit of the Hutterites as it had been at the time of the
great bishop Andreas Ehrenpreis (d. 1662). A major avenue to this end was
the collection and rewriting of the old sermons which at Waldners time
had almost been forgotten. New sermon books were produced by Waldner
and his co-workers, taken from old sermon notebooks. Waldner also
incorporated excerpts from these sermons into the Klein-Geschichtsbuch.
This made an invaluable inheritance for the brethren, which has continued
alive to this day and which is the very center of all their piety. Waldner
also renewed the old Gemeindeordnungen and insisted on their
observance. In short, he became the rejuvenator of the brotherhood at a
time when it was particularly difficult to continue the tradition. That the
Hutterites could survive so strongly through the ages (after the conclusion

of the heroic first century) is due mainly to the work of three outstanding
men: Ehrenpreis, Waldner, and Elias Waldner.

Waldner, Michael, a Hutterian Brethren minister, chosen in 1856 in
Russia, and confirmed in office in 1858. With Jakob Hofer he reestablished community of goods in 1859. He died Oct. 13,1889, in the Bon
Homme Bruderhof in South Dakota, at the age of 55 years, having served
in the ministry 33 years.

Johannes Waldner Dies
Johannes Waldner died on the 14th of December 1824 at the age of
seventy-five years at the village of Neudorf. He served in the ministry for
forty-two years. The entire congregation entrusted to him for thirty-one
years. He was one of those who came from Carinthia to Transylvania, fled
over the mountains, suffered persecution in Wallachia, suffered whipping
and plunder, as can be read in a book, which he personally wrote in his
own handwriting up to 1802.
After the death of Johannes Waldner, Jacob Walther was elected elder
of the entire congregation who took faithful charge of the fallen
congregation with the help of Brother Joseph Kleinsasser. Shortly after the
death of Brother Johannes Waldner, two brethren were elected for the
ministry, which fell upon the brethren Jacob Hofer and George Waldner, a
son of the deceased Johannes Waldner. This took place January 10th,
1825.
The congregation suffered great poverty in its private ownership, so
that many were short of bread. Everyone had to see for himself how to
survive with wife and children which was a difficulty under the meager
land ownership. In various ways and means they had to earn their bread
with blacksmithing, turning, weaving, pottery, digging and working in the
timber felling trees and transporting them. Only a few of them had one
horse. Otherwise everything was done with oxen. It was a miserable life.

Even the school which we and our forefathers always considered one of
the first necessities was entirely neglected. Children grew up who couldn’t
read or write a single letter. This had never happened in any period of our
history. Our congregation was threatened with ruin in temporal as well as
spiritual existence.

Kleinsasser
Kleinsasser, a common family name among the Hutterian Brethren. Its
progenitor was Johannes Kleinsasser (d. 1779, Vishenka, Russia) of
Aemlach, Carinthia, Austria. He was a leader of the group of Lutherans
expelled from Carinthia and taken to Transylvania by Maria Theresa when
they refused to return to the Catholic Church. In 1755 the group went to
Alwine, where a number, including Kleinsasser was baptized and
appointed as leader on probation in 1762 and ordained in 1763. The name
is now found in South Dakota, Montana, Manitoba, and Alberta.

Kleinsasser, Johannes, of Aemlach in Carinthia, Austria, was the leader of
the Protestants who were persecuted in their homeland and were by
compulsion settled in Transylvania in the 1750’s. By this time the
heterodox were not simply banished from the country, for the refugees
might then strengthen a hostile power, but were sent to a crown land,
which enjoyed certain freedoms. Kleinsasser took his family with him; his
wife Barbara, and four children, Stephan, Mathias, Joseph and Christina.
In Transylvania Kleinsasser united with the group of his compatriots who
refused to give the oath of allegiance to Maria Theresa, believing the oath
to be forbidden by the New Testament. Thus he deprived himself of the
right to a home and land, and united with the Hutterites at Alwine, which
entailed privation, hardship, and want. His son Stephan died the first year
in Transylvania. The following year he and his family were transferred to
Kreuz. A pious man, he held his brethren to continued prayer.
When the small group took steps to order its life in spiritual and temporal
affairs, the vote for leader in 1761 fell on Kleinsasser, and after he had

been baptized with Joseph Muller in 1762, and received instructions on the
essential doctrines, such as baptism, communion, marriage, exclusion
from the group and reception, he was installed as leader on April 27, 1762
and confirmed in that position in January 1763. The Alwine colony gave
him the necessary books for study. Thus the congregation had a shepherd.
His position was an extremely difficult one, not wanting in mistreatment
and chains. It was therefore decided to try to find a place where they could
live more peacefully. They found such a place in Wallachia, and in 1775
established themselves there. But peace was shattered by the RussoTurkish war with its terrible consequences. Kleinsasser’s suffering at the
hands of Turkish and Tartar robber bands was described by Johannes
Waldner who later became the leader and chronicler of the brotherhood. “I
prayed,” he writes, “to the Lord in this distress: 0 Lord, wilt Thou thus
make an end of Thy church, and quench Thy truth and Thy light and let it
perish?” That is Impossible!”
The offer of Count Rumyantsev to give the plundered brotherhood a
peaceful home on his lands was very welcome. In Vishenka, Kleinsasser
used his talents to develop the colony. Weaving made a good start the first
year; pottery was successful by 1773, a smithy and mills were built. A
room was built for the meetings of the elders, and also a cold pantry. In
1778 they built the big and little schools, and in 1779 a chapel, which was
later turned into a nursery.
Waldner reports that God granted blessed years with good crops; the
brotherhood recovered from the extreme poverty of previous years.
“Hansel” Kleinsasser, elder and leader of the entire brotherhood, died at
Vishenka on Oct. 16, 1779, in his fifty-third year, having served the
brotherhood with the utmost devotion for 18 years.

Gross, Gross, a Mennonite family name. On the basis of historical
inference, and in the absence of published genealogies, the Gross family
name may have had its inception in the Austrian Tirol among the early
Hutterites, though this is not established. The name appears among the
Hutterites in Russia after the migration of 1770. When, in 1819, the
practice of community of goods was abandoned at Radicheva, there were

Grosses among those who abandoned the practice. During the emigration
of Hutterites to America following 1874 the name Gross appeared among
those who settled on the non-communal farms in South Dakota.
In the following years independent churches were organized, composed
entirely of non-colonist Hutterites. Some of these churches joined the
Mennonite (GCM) conference, and a number of their members, leaving
the farm for the town, or marrying Mennonites, joined Mennonite (GCM)
congregations. The name appears predominantly among the South Dakota
Mennonites. Harold H. Gross has been dean of the Freeman College since
1945.

COMMUNAL FARMERS-THE HUTTERITE BRETHREN
by Marvin P. Riley

The Hutterites are farmers living in small agricultural villages
commonly referred to as “colonies.” There were 91 Hutterite colonies in
North America in 1950 with a total population of 8,500 persons. Fifteen of
these colonies were located in South Dakota and had a population of
slightly over 1,200 members. The total acreage owned by the South
Dakota colonies in 1950 was approximately 54,000 acres or an average of
about 3500 acres for each colony.
Renewed interest in the Hutterites has been stimulated in South
Dakota by the location of colonies in Beadle, Faulk, Hand, and Spink
counties in recent years. This article is the first phase of a study designed
to provide information on the organization of Hutterite Colonies and
communal farming. Among the questions many South Dakotans are asking
about the Hutterites are: “Who are these people? Where do they live?
What do they believe?”
***************

WHO THEY ARE
The answer to this question is not as simple as one might think. As a
religious group the Hutterites are not a new sect but a very old one. They
originated in Moravia in 1528, an offshoot of the Swiss Brethren. They are
one of the many Anabaptist groups that arose directly out of the Protestant
reformation struggles of sixteenth century Europe.
The founders of the Hutterian Brotherhood subscribed to the
Anabaptist beliefs of adult baptism and the separation of church and state.
Like the Swiss Brethren, they were strongly opposed to war. In addition
the Hutterites interpreted the New Testament literally, insisting on the
complete sharing of worldly possessions. Many of these beliefs ran
counter to those held by the established churches of that day and, as
Europe was in an almost constant state of war, the rulers were not tolerant
of pacifists. Consequently, the Hutterites as well as other Anabaptist
groups were often the object of severe persecution.

Jacob Hutter
In 1533, Jacob Hutter, the Anabaptist preacher from whom the sect
derives its name, joined the group and became their pastor. Through the
efforts of Hutter and his assistants a well-defined communal pattern was
established which has continued to the present. Hutter was burned at the
stake in 1536 for his convictions.

Hutterites in Europe
The history of the Hutterites in Europe includes three periods. Almost
a century was spent in Moravia, approximately a century and a half in
Hungary, Transylvania, and Wallachia, and a little more than a century in
Russia.

In Moravia the nobles considered the Hutterites good tenants and
protected them from attacks by the Catholic Church and the Emperor as
long as possible. However, the power of the nobles was broken in 1620,
and the Hutterites were forced to flee Moravia. For more than 150 years
they wandered through Hungary and neighboring countries. Although
often close to extinction, a small group always managed to survive and
carry on the faith.
Finally, upon invitation of Catherine the Great, the surviving
Hutterites moved to Russia in 1770 to settle the Ukraine frontier. There
they were given refuge and allowed to practice pacifism. An edict
nullifying their grant or exemption from military service was issued in
1871. After an appeal to the crown failed, their nonresistance policy
demanded they emigrate.

***************

WHERE THEY LIVE
Settlement in Dakota Territory
Approximately one hundred Hutterite families arrived in Yankton
from Russia between 1874 and 1879. These families divided about equally,
one group choosing to establish colonies, while the other families chose to
settle on private farms. Many of the latter group have become affiliated
with the Mennonite Church.
The Hutterites established their first colony in Dakota Territory about
18 miles west of Yankton in 1874. The Colony was named Bon Homme.
Because the leader of this colony, Michael Waldner, was a blacksmith
(Schmied) by trade, these people and their descendants were called
Schmiedeleut (the Smith’s people).
Later in 1874 another group of Hutterites arrived and settled about 12
miles west of Freeman under the leadership of Darius Walter. They
established Wolf Creek Colony. Their descendants are called Dariusleut

(Darius people). New Elm Spring Colony was founded by the third group
which came in 1877 and were led by two teachers, this group settled
northeast of Parkston. Descendants of this group are referred to as
Lehrerleut (Teacher’s people).

Early Daughter Colonies
The period from 1878 to 1913 was a time of increase in the number of
colonies in South Dakota. By the process of branch colonization the three
mother colonies established daughter colonies along the James River.
By 1913, Bon Homme had placed three daughter colonies: old
Milltown, old Maxwell, and old Huron. Milltown Colony had two
daughters of her own - old Rosedale and old James Valley. Wolf Creek
(mother colony of the Dariusleut) had produced five daughters by this
time, old Jamesville, old Tschetter, old Spink and Richards. Old
Jamesville had a daughter of her own—Yale colony. Branch colonies of
Old Elm Springs (Lehrerleut) included old Rockport, New Elm Spring, and
Milford. Thus, in 1913, there were 17 Hutterite colonies in South Dakota
—6 were Schmiedeleut; 7, Dariusleut; and 4, Lehrerleut.
(2007) Now there are 180 Schmiedeleut colonies; 156 Dariusleut; and
136 Lehrerleut.
When the population of a colony reaches 100 to 150 persons, the
membership is divided approximately in half. One half remains at the
colony site, the other half (the daughter colony) is assisted in setting up a
colony at a new location.

Migration to Canada
Strong sentiment against the Hutterites German culture and
conscientious objection to war along with proceedings to annul their
corporation charters created a difficult situation for the Hutterites in South

Dakota during World War I. As a result, 12 colonies left the states for
Canada in 1918. Four more colonies had followed by 1934. Only Bon
Homme colony remained.

Present Colonies
In 1934 Bon Homme started Rockport Colony near Alexandria on the
site of a vacated colony. The 1935 Legislature passed a law allowing
communal societies to incorporate, and in 1936 one colony returned to
South Dakota from Canada.
Contrary to a common conception, only six of the present South
Dakota colonies have come from Canada. The first one to come was New
Elm Springs, a granddaughter of Bon Homme, which settled near Ethan.
(They branched from Maxwell Colony, MB then to Sundale Colony,
“Alsask” from 1932–1935) Another granddaughter, Jamesville, returned
from Huron Colony, MB in 1937 to its present site near Utica. (Thorndale
“Sharpe” 1924-1929 to Roseile 1929-1937) Tschetter, (from Barrickman to
Teulon1934-1936 and back to Barrickman again) founded in 1941, is a
great granddaughter of Bon Homme which reoccupied an old colony site
near Olivet when it came from Canada. Spink, from Bon Homme, and
Huron, from Jamesville, were started in 1944 on old colony sites near
Frankfort and Huron, respectively.
In 1945, Rosedale was established near the Rockport Colony from
which it came. During 1948, Glendale, a third Bon Homme granddaughter,
came from Canada to locate near Frankfort, Pearl Creek came from Huron,
MB and settled near Iroquois, and Maxwell from New Elm Springs,
located near Scotland.
Four colonies began in 1949—Bon Homme started the Platte colony
near Academy; Rockport began Riverside north of Huron; Tschetter started
Gracevale near Winfred; and Millerdale, a granddaughter of Bon Homme,
came from Milltown, MB to a site southwest of Miller. Blumengart, a
great-granddaughter of Bon Homme from Blumengart, MB settled north
of Wecota the following year. The most recent colony was started in 1955

when Jamesville bought land near Raymond to begin the Clark colony. All
of the present 17 South Dakota colonies belong to the Schmiedeleut group.
The first New Elm Springs colony was of the Lehrerleut group; the present
New Elm Springs Colony is of the Schmiedeleut group.
***************

WHAT THEY BELIEVE
The Hutterites are readily distinguished from their rural neighbors by
their garb and mode of life. The men have full beards and black denim
clothes. The women wear dark full skirts and headscarves; the colony has
a machine shop, communal dining hall, and plain church. All these attest
to a people living an unusual life. Why do these people live as they do? To
understand the Hutterian way of life it is necessary to know what they
believe.

Central Beliefs
Dr. Lee Deets, (Lee E. Deets, The Hutterites: A Study in Social
Cohesion. Times and News Publishing Co., Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,
1939, pp. 16-28.) in his study of Hutterite communities in the 1930’s,
found that all sanctioned activity within the community is ordered around
central beliefs. Any consideration of their central beliefs would
undoubtedly include the following:

The Hutterian way of life is God-sanctioned and God-commanded.
Relation to the Diety is governed by the belief that God is the creator, the
supreme all-powerful being to whom all else one should give obedience.
For them, the Hutterian way of life is sanctioned by an infinitely wise
Deity who must be obeyed even to martyrdom. Their beliefs are regarded
as expressions of the will of God as revealed through a literal
interpretation of the scriptures.

The principle of communal living
The Hutterites believe in and practice communal living, holding their
goods and property in common. Basic to their principle of communal
living is the concept of Christian love. They believe that the highest
expression of the Christian ideal of brotherly love is possible only through
the self-denial and sacrifice that is involved in communal living. The idea
constituting the principle of communal living is revealed in a statement
from their petition to President Woodrow Wilson in 1918:
“Our community life is founded on the principle,”
“What is mine is thine,” or in other words on brotherly love and
humble Christian service, according to Acts 2:44-45; “And all that
believed were together, and had all things in common; and sold their
possessions and goods and parted them to all men, as every man had
need.”
The importance the Hutterites attach to the principle of communal
living is indicated by another statement from the same petition:
“Our community life is based on God’s Word, and we could not serve
God according to the dictates of our conscience if we were not permitted
to live together in our communities. Our members would, by the help of
God, suffer what He may permit, rather than consent to leave the
community life.”

The principle or nonresistance
Their interpretation of Christianity is that Christians are not to serve
in war nor are they to take revenge. The principle or nonresistance is not
unique to the Hutterites as it is practiced by other religious sects such as
the Quakers and the Amish. Biblical admonitions cited to support the

belief in nonresistance include: Luke 2:8-20; Isaiah 2:1-4; Micah 4:1-4:
and Romans 12:14-21.

Avoidance and nonconformity
Hutterites desire, as is also true of such groups as the Amish, to
remain as far as possible from the influences of the outside world. Worldly
pleasures are to be avoided. The plain, simple life preferred. Christians,
according to their belief, should not be conformed to the world (Romans
12:2). Nonconformity is expected in those things in which standards of the
world conflict with Bible standards. Their occupation of farming and
location of their communities in relatively isolated rural areas help to
maintain their principles of avoidance and nonconformity.

Other Related Beliefs
The preceding enumerated beliefs of the Hutterians are not to be
considered all-inclusive. Growing out of and in many ways supporting the
central beliefs are many other doctrines which help cement their religious
and social structure. Among these are admonitions against pride, patterns
of discipline, and restrictions on apparel and ornamentation. These more
specific teachings also have scriptural basis and are just as binding as the
central beliefs. They help to translate the central beliefs into rules for
practical living.

WHEN PEOPLE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY
J. J. Mendel

The first thing on the program upon arriving at Yankton was to look
for an ox team or a team of horses. After a man had a team he slowly
wended his way north through the tall grass. Sometimes a horse and an ox
were hitched together. The future was dark. There were hopes and
anxieties about the qualities of the land. It took much courage to undertake
building up and developing of a new and untried region but, all were
embued with ambition and enthusiasm.
After reaching this locality and picking their homestead, some kind
of a home was needed. The sod house or shanty was put up and some mud
houses were built. Along the Jim River some had log cabins. They had the
timber. Soon small claim shacks began to dot the prairies. For the wall,
sod or mud was used and, over the planked roof, loose earth or sod was
spread. Later the thatched or straw roof was used on some buildings. In
some cases planks of native timber were used. As poor as these old timers
were, they had to face blizzards, prairie fires, grasshopper plagues and
other ravages of nature. Snowstorms blew snow through the keyhole into
the room and piled up inside. There were no plowed fields to stop a prairie
fire.
The people were industrious and soon these shacks were replaced by
better homes and family life changed. The home was arranged similar to
the homes in Russia. The house had only a dirt floor. A brick kiln
separated the house into two rooms. This kiln was called a Russian stove
and served them for heating and cooking. The bread was baked in the
oven, in long pans. Borst, sauerkraut, baked potatoes, roasted meats etc.
were also cooked in the oven. The oven was heated with straw or hay.
There was very little furniture in the house and often when visitors came
boxes had to be used for seating.
***************

FAMILY LIFE
People were simple but sociable. In Russia they lived in villages and
the change here made them feel very lonesome. To break lonesomeness
they hitched up a team. The whole family would drive to neighbors to
spend Sunday afternoon or evening.
The homestead bride was a modest damsel. No formality on her
wedding day! Nobody dreamed of a honeymoon trip or a long write-up in a
newspaper. Hand in hand they proceeded to their plain home to share life’s
joys and sorrows. A rolling pin, a potato masher and some plain pieces of
homemade furniture was all the newlyweds expected and they were
satisfied because they knew only simplicity of life.
Women used a piece of red handkerchief for a hair ribbon, no face
powder decorations, simple clothing, no white and brown shoes and a pair
of boots (Rohrstiefel) for men. The shoes were bought big enough to save
the search for a corn cure. High heels were not known. The stockings
mother knitted did not have all kinds of colors, like Jacob’s coat.
The home was illuminated with tallow dips or candles. The water was
pulled up in a bucket from a well. In case of sickness the neighbors were
very helpful and accommodating, not only in helping with the work but
also in suggesting treatments. They would come and sit through the hours
of the night with the afflicted one. It was neighborly duty with them to
render this service, which is being done today by a special nurse. In case
of death undertakers were unknown. The neighbors would continue their
service sitting with the departed, digging the grave, and performing other
acts of helpfulness. To charge for this service would have been a disgrace.
The coffin was homemade by some local carpenter. Flowers for the coffin
were absent. The doctor in those days had to be a real hero to respond to a
call 30 or 40 miles away.
The Christmas spirit moved quietly in those days. A cheap doll for a
girl and a cheap toy for a boy. In those days holidays were not as much
commercialized as today. The “why” was more impressed on the children.

On Sunday morning the whole family drove to church, some by horse,
some by ox team drawing a lumber wagon. Services were much longer
than today.
A party who has been a clerk in a Freeman store for almost fifty years
says in the old days women came to town twice a year, spring and fall.
Store conditions have changed and so have the customers. The customers
are harder to satisfy than they used to be because there are so many
varieties to select from.
Parents living on the farm who had children of school age found it
inconvenient here compared to Russia where they lived in a village. At
first the school term was only three months but soon the school year was
much longer. Dressing was very simple. Evenings were spent at home by
young and old. Fathers were busy making some homemade articles and
mothers kept their spinning wheel running. Youngsters were busy making
some playthings at home, yet those pioneer children and grandchildren
enjoyed life just as much, if not more, than many today who are spoiled by
their indulgences.
In those early days people believed in going to bed early. They
believed in the saying, “Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man
healthy, wealthy and wise.” When one borrowed money from another, the
man who borrowed the money took the money and the note so he would
know when the note was due. That shows their honesty and confidence in
each other.
The children were always under home influence while today so many
are under outside influence. The auto contributes much to this change. We
do not want to be a calamity howler but, it’s an actual fact, in pioneer days
the people, young and old, were more content and more grateful than now
with all our modern conveniences and the highest standard of living in the
world, and possessing the highest degree of intelligence attainable. This
“push button age” is not enough appreciated by our present generation. A
person must go through hardship before he can appreciate good days. Too
many are born today with a golden spoon in their mouth.

PIONEER FARMING
Early day farming was a matter of hard work and very limited return
for your sweat, just barely sufficient for food supply and a few dollars in
cash. These settlers were all farmers in the old country and they were
determined to stick to that occupation here in America. They knew how to
operate a farm in the old country but it was like an experiment station to
them here. No county agent could be consulted for advice. The
government had three methods of granting land. The government was very
anxious to have the land settled. A man or woman had a chance to file on a
homestead. Filing fee was $14.00 and you had to live on the land. You
could also file on a timber claim and plant 10 acres of trees. You could
also file on preemption after you filed on a homestead. It cost $200.00 to
prove a timber claim. If one could prove that someone did not live on his
homestead, the title could be contested. They were called “claim jumpers”
and were very unpopular. In the early days when land was opened for
settlement people rushed for land like thirsty cattle to a pond.
The first thing a farmer needed was a walking plow to turn the sod.
The power to pull the plow was usually an ox team. Today if you want
more power you give more gas. At that time they used a bigger whip or
twisted oxtail for more power. Other machines needed were a seeder and a
drag. Much sowing was done by hand. They also needed a grass mower,
rake, and harvester for cutting the grain. For the binding straw was used as
long as the binding was done by hand. In a few years the self-binder was
invented. At first wire was used for binding but they changed to twine
binding because cattle died due to wire in the straw. Mice and crickets
liked the change. For corn planting the hand planter was used and some
claimed to plant as many as 9 acres a day. They worked long hours in the
early days. 9 acres meant walking many miles in plowland.
Threshing seemed to have a social side for the young people because
there was a crew of some 20 people. If not enough beds, some slept in the
haymow. Mother had to work hard to feed the crew. The machine was
driven by horsepower, 5 to 7 teams walking in a circle. They protected
gardens by a ditch around the garden to keep livestock out. Labor was paid

75 cents a day or $15.00 a month. To get a supply of flour, wheat was
taken to the mill and exchanged for flour.
In the early days people cooperated without a Co-op. Co.
organization. If a building was lost all the neighbors helped to build it
without pay. The winter of 1880-1881 had many snowstorms and the snow
on the flat roofs of the barns of mud and sod often caved in and the cows
had to be taken out of the barn through the roof.
The closest market was Yankton and produce was hauled to Yankton
by ox team. Wheat was sold for 40 cents a bushel, eggs 6 cents, butter 6
cents. But, the time from 1890 to 1900 improved much. Old homes and
barns were replaced by new ones, more modern machinery was used.
Steam engines were being used, and gasoline engines came in for
threshing and other purposes. More buggies and carriages were bought.
Salaries for teachers varied from, $16 to $50 a month. Around 1900 land
price raised to $50 an acre and many went north to file on land. What
would the old pioneer, who went to his eternal resting place some 65 years
ago, say if he would see the present conditions: Ñairplanes flying, autos
moving 90 miles per hour, combines cutting and threshing the grain, when
he had to cut, bind, shock, stack and thrash his grain. Or, compare the
tractor plowing to ox-team plowing or the conveniences in the house: the
electric washer, ironing, etc. Hauling the grain to Yankton at 40 cents a
bushel seems trouble enough.
The year 1879 when the first train whistle was heard in Freeman
ended much trouble and developed many wonderful improvements. The
first train whistle in Freeman was sweeter music to the old timers than
anything that was ever sung here since that time, and we know how much
good singing is heard in Freeman.
***************

WHY SOME MOVED NORTH,
Land raised in price and young people went north to file on land. By
1900 land sold at $15 to $25 an acre.,

THINGS WORTH KNOWING
It’s amusing looking back to your childhood days and hearing the
sound of the coffee grinder in the kitchen early in the morning. In the early
days they always bought green coffee. Another thing to think about is the
burning of hay and straw for heating. When bedtime came the stove was
filled up with hay or straw but the next morning when the fire was started
there was ice in the water pail. Those lucky enough to have flax straw were
on easy street because it gave more heat. In those days they had no rugs,
and the ashes on the floor were no bother. Seeding was done by hand and
when harvest time came grain was cut. You grabbed a handful of grain,
made your straw band tied it around the grain, and dropped it to the
ground. The harvester machine did the cutting and it took 3 men to do the
binding. Today the combine goes over the grain and its ready for the
market.
We hear so much these days about cyclones. The first cyclone was seen
here on August 28, 1884. It moved from the Clayton vicinity towards the
Neu Hutterthal Church vicinity in the afternoon and killed Elias Wipf, 74
years old, his daughter in law Mary and her 8 year old son, and caused
much damage at different farms.
To give you an idea how different conditions were in the early days, my
uncle and teacher D. J. Mendel taught school at $16.00 a month. When we
started teaching in 1898 our salary was $35.00 a month. We taught for four
years and the last year received $50.00 a month. This gives you an idea
how conditions changed.
***************

CHANGES SINCE 1875
This settlement is 80 years old and nearly everything has changed
except the beautiful sunshine. We have today the same beautiful sunshine
the pioneers had 80 years ago and the same climate. These two things man

cannot change. They remain the way the Creator made them. The best way
to realize the many changes is by enumerating them, and we shall try to
mention at least some of them.

The ironing was done by heating the flat iron on the stove. Now the
electric power is used.
Buffalo chips were gathered for fuel.

Nobody talked about garages or airports or filling stations.

Eggs were brought in from the farm in a pail filled with oats. If they didn’t
like the eggs you could always sell the oats.

Young men went to the city to learn the English language. Jacob Hieb
of Marion, and John Schamber went to Sioux City to learn the English
language.

There was no wristwatch or alarm clock. The farmer unloaded his
corn with a small shovel. There was no elevator.

There were no farm organizations. Today a farmer spends much time
at his writing desk to fill out all kinds of papers.

Limestones were gathered on the farm river hills and converted into
lime after being placed on the fire in an oven for some 10 days and nights,
and used for building.

Women and girls were doing considerable fieldwork. The Spinning
wheel was also kept busy so the girls had warm stockings when winter
came.

Twisted hay was used for the stove.

Compare the plowing with an ox-team and a walking plow in the
early days to plowing with a tractor. The man sitting under an umbrella
steering the tractor and sometimes even listening to his radio while
plowing.

Vacations and 8-hour days were unknown in the early days and how
could they go out and travel by ox team? Today it’s an annual affair with
most of the people.

In the early days when milking was done the milk had to be placed
where it was cool, then skimmed, churned, and taken to the market. Today
we have the milking machine. The electric button is pressed to start the
separator, and the creamery man calls daily to take the cream.

In the early days farmers raised broomcorn and made their own
brooms. Many of the early settlers had no wooden floor for years. The

mud floor was strewn with sand to keep it smooth and easier for sweeping.
Today their children use the electric carpet sweeper.

They used twisted hay and straw when they had no wood to fill up the
stove. Today they turn on the electric switch or the bottle gas stove.

Yeast was made at home. Today if the store has no yeast the only
substitute is bread from the bakery.

The girls never dreamed of an artificial complexion in the pioneer
days. There were just as many pretty girls as now, and maybe more. Girls
used to have braids. Now they have bobbed hair and permanents.

Farmers started to work at 5 in the morning and worked till dark.
Lunch was brought out between meals. Now they don’t quit even at dark
some days but run the tractor all night to make up time to go on vacation.

12 teams and a large force of men were needed to operate a threshing
machine. Now the combine cuts, shocks, threshes and one man operates
the machine.

Tallow dipped candles were used for light. Now you press a button
and you have light.

Water was pulled from the well in buckets. Now you turn on the
faucet and you have the water.

Men in business had to add long columns of figures. Now the adding
machines do it.

Compare the washday with the washboard to the present electric
washer.

The simple life was preached by Teddy Roosevelt about how to find
pleasure in work, but it was actually practiced by the pioneers long before
him.

When the supply of molasses was low mother took a jug to the store
and it was filled up from the big barrel. Some had their homemade
molasses. Sugar cane was planted and hauled to the syrup press where the
syrup was prepared. One press was located in Wittenberg and one at the
Wolf Creek Colony. These two served the vicinity.

Meat was salted and smoked to prepare it for keeping. Now they take
it to the locker and put it in the deep freeze.

Sidewalks were made from planks and the cracks were big enough for
a high-heeled shoe to get stuck in the crack but, at that time shoes had big
heels and nobody was bothered. If by accident a man dropped a piece of
silver money and it rolled into the crack the plank was raised and the

money was not lost. Weeds grew up through the cracks on Main Street.
How much different now!

Stores trusted everybody, never took an inventory, placed orders
almost a year ahead and made money. With the changing styles today you
cannot do it that way. Now orders are phoned in in the morning to be sure
to get the article in the afternoon.

Swan Lake was a very important place for people here. They had a
branch land office. Min. Paul F. Gross served on the star route between
Freeman and Swan Lake.

Women folks had to sew, knit and run the spinning wheel besides
cooking. Today with a sewing machine and all conveniences they get more
time to attend society clubs.

The first few years no interest was taken in politics. Now you can
meet a little pinheaded politician almost on every street corner before
election.

Money was very scarce in the early days and the rate of interest high.
The highest interest on record that was charged was 60 percent.

As an optimist and a hustler, never forget the early merchant. He had
long hours from early till late in the night every day.

With poor transportation some articles got very scarce at times. In
1876 kerosene sold in Deadwood at $10.00 a gallon. They had a pony
express from St. Joseph, Mo., to San Francisco, Calif.

In the early days farmers raised many wagonloads of watermelons.
Every spring much sod was turned and the seed was planted in the soil and
no more cultivation was needed. Today it’s not so easy to raise
watermelons. Even county agents cannot stop weeds from growing.

The menu was simple in the early days. Sauerkraut, borst, homemade
bacon, homemade cookies, etc. Nobody was operated on, or had high
blood pressure so people must have lived right. They ate to live and now
live to eat. A prominent hospital physician told us not long ago that he is
wondering why there is not more sickness as little attention as people pay
to their diet. Anything that tickles the palate is swallowed regardless of
consequences.

In the early days every man in town had a cow for the milk supply.
The boy had to feed and water the cow after school and mornings, and also
keep the barn clean. It was also his job to see that the wood box was filled.
Once in a while you heard Mama say, “This is the last time I tell you
Sonny, to have that wood box filled.” This training of the boy to work was
worth much more than the milk. Not long ago a disease among cows was
reported in a large city and people began to worry. A city boy said, “We
don’t need to worry, we get our milk from the bottle.” But our boys know
the milk in the bottle comes from the cow. In the early days, in many
cases, the boy went to the farm when school closed and learned to work on
the farm during the summer. No doubt he got just as much good out of that
training as any boy scout today.

The stockyards were always a busy place. Kids are always anxious to
see something and all of us remember how a gang of kids would sit on the
high wooden fences and watch the buyers and farmers unload stock.
***************

PIONEER LIFE
Pioneer Life on the Dakota prairies was not easy, especially for those
who had experienced the luxuries of their Russian homes.
When the early settlers came there were no landmarks to designate
where one section ended and another began. They had to take a surveyor
along to locate the sections of land, for as far as the eye could see there
was nothing but tall grass and no sign of any road. That is why the fathers
had to take a surveyor along to mark the corners of the sections by little
mounds of dirt and numbered poles.
Supplies had to be brought from Yankton, fifty miles away.
There was no city or village any closer, except perhaps the one at Swan
Lake. Sioux Falls did not exist. The trip to Yankton had to be made with
horse and wagon or possibly oxen. It took a day to drive to Yankton. A day
was spent in making the purchases and then another day to return. Water
also was a big problem. It had to be hauled sometimes a great distance.
They plowed up the sod and with the sod they laid the walls of their
homes. Even the ends were laid up into the gable. This was covered with
boards and sod was placed on the roof which would not permit the heat to
escape in the winter. These houses did not have a floor, only a roof. They
were warm homes for the winter but, they were built no larger than
necessary.
The sod had to be broken with horses or oxen. Then came the task of
removing the many rocks, both large and small. For years one could see
large piles of rocks on every farm. Tons of rocks had been laboriously
gathered, hauled on a stone boat, and then dumped on these piles. Now
with the advent of the bulldozer, many of these piles have been deeply
buried to make room for better farming.

Then there was the great scourge of prairie fires. Fireguards had to be
plowed around homes and feed stacks. One old grandmother, who as a girl
went through these experiences, tells how one day a fire was seen
approaching. Hurriedly, the valuable things like bedding and chairs were
put into the well, hoping to save them, even if the house would be
consumed. The house was saved but, a spark landed in the well and the
valuable possessions therein were destroyed.
Fuel also was hard to get. Some was found along the river, but that
involved hard work and hauling. Hay was made not only for feed, but also
for fuel, for this took the place of coal for the winter. Buffalo chips or cow
dung was also gathered. The old Russian stoves were so built that prairie
hay and marsh grass, as well as straw, could be burned to heat the homes
and to cook the meals. In the upper part of the cavernous chimneys, almost
a room in itself, were hung the hams and bacon to be smoked. Within the
chimney was found a smaller stove on which the food was cooked.
Blizzards also added to the dangers of early pioneer life. One old
pioneer tells how during the blizzard of 1881 he was caught out in the
pasture. It was futile to try to drive the cattle or to find his way home. He
got down on his hands and knees and with his bare fingers felt for the
depressions made by the cattle going to and from the creek to the barn.
Thus he found his way back to the barn and safety.
Being a religious people, determined that their faith should be
preserved for their children, the Russian Mennonites organized churches
and established schools from the start. We began our day school
immediately, November 1875. This school continued until 1879. Peter
Goertz was teacher. Teacher Goertz also started a Sunday School in 1878.
The Sunday School met on Sunday afternoon during the summer months.
The sessions lasted about two hours. Some of these children, now grown,
tell of how they were taken to certain homes for their instruction in the
fundamentals of learning. Some were left in the home of the schoolteacher
to board with him for the school term. These early settlers clung
tenaciously to the German language. It was used both in school and church
but, the daily language was Low German.

MEMORANDA
by John P. Kleinsasser

My parents came to this country from Russia in 1879. We originated
in Switzerland. Finally, at the invitation of Catherine the Great, our people
went to Russia. People that don’t like me have called me a dumb Russian,
until the time of the Sputnik.
My parents came to Yankton. From there by oxen, my father bought
lumber and settled on the SWA of Section 11-99-56. I still live on that
place.
***************

Stories
Father built a sod house. The floor was good South Dakota dirt.
Father often told me he shot prairie chickens from the door of the house.
Antelope often came to eat some of the crops. The lakes and rivers were
filled with fish, and nobody bothered you if you fished with a net. A group
of farmers would go to the James River to fish and often caught tons of
fish. The fish were packed in snow on the north side of the house. Fish
could be had anytime. As soon as the house was built and the family
moved, my parents started breaking some sod. My brother Jake told me
how the parents would break the sod. Father staked out the land. Mother
led the oxen. Father steered the plow. My brother Paul had a long stick to
drive the oxen. My sisters Elizabeth and Anna planted Squaw corn,
melons, and pumpkins.
The town of Marion had a flourmill. The people from North Freeman
would go there to have wheat ground. The story is told of a farmer who
could not read or speak English went to Marion for flour. About a mile out
of Marion he read a sign which said “Marion one mile,” read it “Marion

ohne Mülle.” So he turned around and went back home. History did not
record what his wife told him when he came home without the flour.
My mother’s parents lived about 3 miles from our home as the crow
flies. She wanted to visit her mother as many young married women do.
Two oxen were hitched to the wagon and mother and the children were put
into the wagon. Mother directed the oxen with a haw and gee. Everything
went well till they came to the lake on Johnny Gross’ land. The oxen were
hot and thirsty so they went into the lake with the wagon and mother and
the children. The oxen could not be moved until they had cooled off.
***************

Prairie Fires and the Grasshoppers
Prairie fires were rather common. My parents had the cows staked out
for pasture north of our home. Mother saw the smoke from a prairie fire.
She ran out where the cows were, cut the rope and saved the cows.
Another time, our barn started burning. Father had the livestock in the
barn. He could not get the sheep out any other way except to bodily pick
them up and throw them out. When the door was opened the sheep would
come back in. He got badly burned in that fire.
Father said that there were so many grasshoppers they clouded the
sun and naturally ate all the crops, grass and all.
Our farm has always been in a hail streak. Father was farming 5
quarters of land. One day he had made one or two rounds with the binder
when the hail came and beat the whole crop into the ground. We usually
had hail once or twice in three years.
***************

Snowstorms
1888 was the year of the big snowstorms. Father said that the well
was covered with snow fourteen feet deep. He dug steps in the snow down

to the mouth of the well, pulled up the water, then walked up the steps to
water the livestock. The snow was so deep that if one got off the beaten
track he would sink into the snow and had a hard time getting back. Father
hauled straw from someone east of our place. He had four oxen hitched up.
He would tie the straw with ropes to make a bundle out of it then dragged
it home that way. If one of the oxen would get off the road he had to be
pulled back with the other oxen team.
During the winter he took mother home to her mother. Father said it
was very cold but the windows of the house never froze. He had no fire in
the house so it was nearly as cold inside as it was outside.
***************

Summer Time
The grass was so tall that if a cow or horse would lay down they could
not be seen or found until they would get up. The grass was used for fuel.
The grass was twisted into rope and then the fire was fed. The women and
men were busy making a living so they were happy. Later there was quite
an advance made in fuel. They used cow chips. Another method was to
make blocks out of well-tramped sheep manure. It would be dried and
used for fuel. A few acres of crops were planted. Father told me that there
was a field of corn but, before it could be harvested, the wild ducks ate it
all. If he would shoot at them on one end of the field they would fly to the
other end until the whole field of corn was devoured.
***************

Threshing
The first threshing machine had a straw carrier and a man on the
straw pile pushing the straw away. The strings had to be cut by hand and
the machine fed by hand. The grain was all sacked and usually stored
upstairs in the house or barn. The machine was driven by horsepower. Six
pairs of horses were hitched to the power. Later the machines were driven
by a stationary gas engine. Some also used the steam engine. Threshing

was always a community affair. If it rained that put a stop to threshing.
One morning they looked out and the yard was covered with water so the
threshers went back to sleep. When they woke up later they found out it
had not rained at all but somebody had drained the water tank. The man on
the straw pile often wanted water so he would yell “ho” and the horses
would stop, then the man on the straw pile would get his drink. Then,
everything had to start over again.
***************

Education
Education was rather meager. Many of the people could only speak
German. Around the Bridgewater area a traveler stopped at the farmhouse
and asked where Bridgewater was. The boy ran to the house and told his
mother the man wants bread and water “Brot and Wasser”. To poke fun at
someone who had been in school and had not made good, a few stories are
told. Stories are told about the farmer who had many cows. He had one son
so he sent him to school. He did not do so well so he came home before
the end of school. One day a neighbor was visiting and he noticed most of
the man’s cows were gone. The son was just then walking across the yard
and the farmer said, “That ox took all the cows.”
Another farmer sent his son to school and when he came home he
started a chicken ranch. A few days after the chicks were hatched he came
to one of the neighbors and said his chicks were dying. The neighbor asked
him what he was feeding them. The young man said, “Why feed them,
don’t they suck???”
Butchering was an event for celebrating. Several families would be
invited to come and help butcher. Usually several hogs and a cow or steer
would be butchered. I remember a butchering for one of my brother’s
wedding. A few days before the wedding a big, fat cow was butchered. In
the Bridgewater area a hog was butchered then the men went for some
refreshments. When they came back the hog was gone. One of the men
rode to the neighbors and asked him if he had seen a dead hog running
around.

The weddings usually lasted three days. Saturday was preparation
day, Sunday the wedding, then Monday was clean up day. If it was time for
a young man to get married, the boy’s parents and some close friends
would go to the girl’s home and ask for the bride. They called it
“aufreden.” Usually it had been pretty well arranged before hand and the
young couple were engaged. Sometimes it misfired and the young man had
to go home without getting engaged. At the weddings there usually were
refreshments other than water. The European custom of having beverages
served had not been forgotten. The saloons were patronized by some.
When someone went to town he would usually go with a wagonload of
wheat and come home with just a load on.
One day a man living west of Freeman went to town with a load of
wheat. He needed some dynamite to blast rocks. He bought the dynamite,
put the box on the seat of the wagon, got a few more refreshments and
started for home. After a while he fell asleep. The horses knew the way
home and everything went well until one horse got tired so they got to the
side of the road. The wagon wheel hit a hole by the culvert and the farmer
fell off. When he woke up he saw the box of dynamite coming down after
him. It is said he was stark sober in a flash. The dynamite did not explode.
A few personal experiences: When I was 6 years old I started herding
sheep. We had several hundred so my sister Katherine and I were to watch
the sheep. For nothing better to do we changed clothing and whenever the
sheep would go astray I would run to get them to the right place again.
That night I got a good licking because I did not do my share of herding.
The folks had watched from at home and the one with the dress on had
done most of the running after the sheep. I didn’t play that game anymore.
When I was seven years old my father took me to a 4th of July
celebration. For spending money he gave me a dime. When I came home
he asked me what I had done with all the money. I also remember that I
could not speak enough English to converse with the other boys in town.
The best fisherman in town and I went fishing one night in the James
River. We set the seines but did not get a single fish. In the morning he
said, “I never go home without fish.” While I did the watching for the
game warden he took his hoop net and in a short time had half a sack of

fish. I went to country school. One morning the mirror showed me that I
had the measles. I did not want to stay home from school so I didn’t tell
my parents. I drove a horse to school hitched to an open sled. I faced a raw
north wind, and when I got to school the measles were gone and so far
have not returned.
As a boy, I usually had something to sell. I remember selling socks
and stockings for a firm in Penna. Then I went to selling bluing. When the
package came I put it on the windowsill. That night it rained and the
bluing got wet and by morning the packages had become unusable. Things
went on for a while then I began to get threatening letters from the Bluing
Co. The last one said that if I didn’t pay in 5 days they would give the case
over to our own state’s attorney for collection. I didn’t have any money
and I was sure I was going to jail. My brother Ike was home that summer.
He must have noticed that my spirits were quite low. He asked me what
was the matter. I told him my troubles. He said that if I worked hard all
summer he would take care of my case so I didn’t have to go to jail. You
never saw a more helpful boy in your life than I was that summer. I later
found out that the state’s attorney mentioned in the letter had been dead
for many years.
People ask me what my mother fed me. It was meat, potatoes and
bread.
***************

Clearing Land
Our land has always had many rocks. In order not to break up the
machinery and in fact break the sod, the rocks had to be cleared. My
mother was a pleasingly plump lady. Her weight was put to good use when
the large boulders had to be dug out of the ground. She would sit on a
timber or crow bar while father would loosen the rock. We had many little
stone piles on the farm.
***************

Blizzard of 1888
One of my uncle’s had had no water at home for his cattle so he had
to take them to his brother for water. He took the cattle on that fateful
morning but none ever came home alive. After the storm the cattle were
found dead, spread over the prairie. Their nostrils were packed with snow
and they all suffocated.
***************

Threshing
I remember one time we had hired someone to do our threshing.
Father then was sickly. He did most of his supervising from the buggy. He
drove up to the machine and he told the operator there was something
wrong with his machine. Father suggested that he stop the machine and
look at the shakers and sieves. The operator said, “I’m running this
machine.” In a few minutes many of his sieves broke. He was repairing the
machine for three days. Father had operated threshing machines for many
years and had a very keen ear to hear if the machine was operating
smoothly. In place of using a jeep or pickup to drive to the field for an
inspection father would use a buggy with one horse hitched to it. I usually
did the driving for him. He told me many stories of things that happened
in Russia and the early days here but I paid little attention to them. When I
would drive and hit a rock, he would say, “Turn around and see whether
you can hit it harder.”
***************

Story Telling
Very few books were read. There were a few of our group who would
read books. Some novels were read then. A group of men would come for
a visit. The one who had read the story was the guest of honour.
Sometimes it would take a whole evening to tell a story. As a boy I would
go along and listen to the stories. If the story teller would tell a ghost story

I was very scared. In fact, being scared of ghosts has never left me. Even
today I am uneasy when I go past a cemetery.
***************

Schools
Schools were started soon after the settlers came. A school house was
built on our farmstead. The teachers were sometimes men who had
nothing else to do or who couldn’t do any other work. I remember the
parents speaking of one who had only one leg. When the pupils had a new
word that they could not pronounce, he would tell them to repeat it.
The ministers were usually the most successful farmers. They did not
get any pay so they had to be good farmers to make enough money and
also to have the respect of the people. Most people measured success by
how much money you could make and how much land you had.
I remember attending the school on our place or rather, going there in
the morning. I was 4 years old and mother wanted to get some of her work
done so she sent me to school. In a few hours I was hungry and I wanted to
go home. I had learned to say, “May I go out.” As soon as I was outside I
would crawl past the window and run home. For a joke the teacher would
sometimes come out and call me back. Then I had to do it all over again.
My father got 160 acres of land for a homestead and 160 for a tree
claim. Each farmer had to plant 10 acres of trees then he got the 160 acres
of land. I don’t know if my father had a pre-emption claim. That was
another way to get some land. Those claims cost some money. I think it
was $2.00 an acre.
My mother was a midwife and when a baby was due to arrive she was
much in demand. Many of the babies born in that period were brought to
the world with the help of my mother.
Often gypsies would stop at the farmhouse and beg for something to
eat. Mother would never let anybody leave our place hungry. The gypsies

would pay for their food by playing some instruments so the children had
entertainment and the gypsies had food.
The men of the road would also stop for food. Often we found a stone
on a post. That was a sign that here you could get food. Some people
would call those men tramps or hobo’s.
During the last Indian uprising the story got around that the Indians
were coming to this part of the state. The doors were bolted overnight and
many people were sure they would be attacked and scalped.
***************

Blood Letting
There seemed to been a belief that blood letting would cure any
disease. The blood letting was done by pricking the skin on the back with a
sharp piercing instrument that made many small holes. Then, a cup was
put on which worked through sucking. Often a pint or more was taken
from a person. Maybe that’s where our blood bank came from. Maybe the
blood letters were as successful as doctors are now. You have to believe —
as our Saviour said, “Your faith has made you well.”
***************

TIMELINE IN AMERICA,
(Copied from J. J. Mendel’s diary
***************

1874
In July 1874 the first Hutterite people arrived in South Dakota and it’s
providential guidance that brought them to South Dakota. The two
Hutterites delegates, Min. Paul Tschetter and his uncle Lorentz Tschetter
who were sent to America from Russia in 1873, to find a new home,

selected a location in the Red River Valley in North Dakota. When the first
Hutterites arrived in New York the land agents got busy and directed them
to Lincoln, Nebraska, where they stayed one month then moved to South
Dakota. Had they located in the Red River Valley, N. Dak. and settled on
private farms there would be very little left of them as a people today. The
Swiss people in East Freeman and the Low Germans at Silver Lake
protested them, more or less, against outside influence in church and
social life. In the course of time these Hutterites on farms joined
Mennonite conferences.
Bon Homme Colony was established on their present location and
Wolf Creek Colony was established east of Silver Lake. In West Freeman
the Hutterdorf people settled on private farms. Min. Michael Waldner and
Joseph Waldner were the leaders of Bon Homme Colony.
In 1875 the New Hutterthal people arrived from Russia and settled
south of Bridgewater, and some in the Jim River Valley. The Wolf Creek
Colony, at that time known as the Dariusleut, settled at Silver Lake. In
1875 they left Silver Lake and bought the Wolf Creek Colony place for
$750.00. Min. Darius Walter was their leader.
Lorentz Tschetter who was one of the two delegates to America to
find a location died that year at the age of 59 years.
Min. Michael Waldner and Joseph Waldner of the Bon Homme
Colony went to Russia to induce the Hutterites still there to join the colony
upon arriving here instead or locating on private farms.
***************

1877
The Hutterites kept on arriving from Russia and in 1877 Elm Spring
Colony was established with 17 families and the leaders were Min. Jacob
Wipf and Min. Peter Hofer.
***************

1878
By this time some grain was raised but the closest market was Yankton
about. 35 miles away.
At that time many prairie fires destroyed buildings.
***************

1879
This year all the Hutterites still in Johanneruh and Hutterthal arrived from
Russia and settled between Bridgewater and Freeman.
This year the railroad was build through here and Freeman was started on
the homestead of Fred Waldner
***************

1880
This was a very dry year and people were discouraged. Some even talked
about going back to Russia.
***************

1881
This was a cold winter and we had many snowstorms. Trains did not run
for months. Hay sold for $20.00 a ton. Crops were poor, wheat had rust
and the yield was 3 to5 bushels to the acre.
***************

1882

Darius and Jacob Walter of the Wolf Creek Colony went to Oregon to look
for a new location where the climate was mild because we went through
the severest winter. But Oregon did not appeal to them.

***************

1894
This year was a total crop failure. Cows sold from $10 to $15 per head,
sheep 90 cents because there was no feed. A mild winter saved the
livestock that was left. The country furnished seed wheat in the spring of
1895.
The Joseph Waldner family left Milltown Colony during church service.
***************

1895
A fair crop was raised this year.
***************

1898
Nine couples were married at Wolf Creek Colony that year.

canes. Wolf Creek Colony had the syrup press – many loads of canes were
unloaded there.
***************

1901
The body of a Prairieleut man has been found near Yankton, cast ashore by
the Missouri River. It is thought to be John Wipf who disappeared from
Bon Homme Colony on Jan. 8.
***************

It has been decided to construct a telephone line north of Freeman as far
north as Jacob L. Hofer with about 18 farmers on the line.
Nineteen families left for Beadle and Spink Counties with their household
