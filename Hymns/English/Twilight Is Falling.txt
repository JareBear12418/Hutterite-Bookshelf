1. Twilight is stealing over the sea,
Shadows are falling dark on the lea;
Borne on the night winds, voices of yore
Come from the far off shore.

Chorus:
Far away beyond the starlit skies,
Where the love light never, never dies,
Gleameth a mansion filled with delight,
Sweet happy home so bright.

2. Voices of loved ones, songs of the past
Still linger round me while life shall last;
Lonely I wander, Sadly I roam,
Seeking that far off home.

3. Come in the twilight, come, come to me
Bringing some message over the sea;
Cheering my pathway while here I roam,
Seeking that far off home.
