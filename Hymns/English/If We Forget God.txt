1. So many are climbing fames golden hills,
By singing of evil that gives the world a thrill;
But I'll sing of Jesus, and tho' they won't hear,
God will bless me for doing His will.

Chorus:
If we forget God, His mercy will flee,
And sin will cover the land and the sea;
If we forget God, Satan will rule,
If we forget God, our nation is doomed.

3. The stories and pictures in most magazines
Now feature new stylings unfit to be seen;
They're placed on the newstand where children can buy,
When they go wrong, do we wonder why?
