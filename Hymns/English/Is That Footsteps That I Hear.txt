1. There is something that's gonna happen
And the day is drawing near
It is time to get excited
Is that footsteps that I hear
Come on Gabriel blow your trumpet
All the dead in Christ shall rise
We are going to a meeting
Just beyond the eastern skies.

Chorus:
Is that footsteps that I hear
Heavenly portals seem so near
Heavenly lights are shining clear
Is that footsteps that I hear.

2. Are you ready for the rapture
When we meet Him in the air
Oh, his coming is growing closer
Is that footsteps that I hear
Many a saint has fought the battle
Won the race and shed the tears
And it's time to get excited
Is that footsteps that I hear.
