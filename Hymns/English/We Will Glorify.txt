1. We will glorify the King of Kings,
We will glorify the Lamb.
We will glorify the Lord of Lords,
Who is the great I Am.

2. Lord Jehovah, reigns in majesty,
We will bow before his throne.
We will worship him in righteousness,
We will worship him alone.

3. He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth,
He is Lord of all who live,
He is Lord above the universe,
All praise to him we give.

4. Oh hallelujah to the King of Kings,
Hallelujah to the Lamb.
Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords,
Who is the great I am.

5. We will glorify the King of Kings,
We will glorify the Lamb.
We will glorify the Lord of Lords,
Who is the great I am.
