1. Hark! the herald angels sing:
Glory to the newborn King;
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!
Joyful all ye nations rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With the'angelic host proclaim;
Christ is born in Bethlehem.

Chorus:
O Bethlehem, dear Bethlehem,
Hark how the glad notes ring!
Hosanna in the highest,
Exalt the newborn King!
The angel throng His praise prolong,
Glory to God they sing,
While heav'n and earth proclaim the birth
Of Christ, the newborn King!

2. Christ by highest heav'n adored;
Christ the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of the Virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail th'incarnate Deity:
Pleased as Man with men to dwell;
Jesus our Emmanuel!

3. Hail, the heav'nborn Prince of Peace,
Hail, the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Ris'n with healing in His wings.
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die:
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
