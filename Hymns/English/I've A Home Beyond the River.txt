1. O, the blessed contemplation,
When with trouble here I sigh;
I've a home beyond the river,
That I'll enter by and by.

Chorus:
I've a home beyond the river,
(I've a home beyond the river,)
I've a man - sion bright and fair,
(I've a mansion bright and fair)
I've a home beyond the river,
(I've a home, a happy home beyond the river,)
I will dwell with Jesus there.

2. O, how sweet t'will be to meet them,
All the ransomed hosts above;
Sweeter still to see the Savior,
Praise Him for redeeming love.

3. Tho' the world is filled with sorrow,
And the teardrops often fall;
There will be but joy and gladness,
Safe inside the jasper wall.

4. Tho' the hills are rough and stony,
And the valley's dark and cold;
I must walk the path before me,
It will someday turn to gold.
