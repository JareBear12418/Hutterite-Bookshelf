1. Let your Word go forth among the nations,
Let your voice be heard among the people;
May they know our God,
The only true God reigns,
On earth, as you reign in heaven.
May your church be bold,
And speak with one voice.
May our hearts be strong
And never failing;
May we know no fear,
Except a holy fear of you, our King.
