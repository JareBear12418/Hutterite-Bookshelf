1. If Jesus came to your house to spend a day or two,
If He came unexpectedly, just drop in on you,
Oh I know you'd give your nicest room to such an honored guest
And all the food you'd serve to Him, would be the very best;
And you would keep assuring Him, you're glad to have Him there
That serving Him in your home is joy beyond compare.

2. But when you saw Him coming would you meet Him at the door,
With arms outstretched in welcome to your Heavenly Visitor
Or would you have to change your clothes before you let Him in,
Or hide some magazines and put the Bibles where they'd been.
Would you turn the radio off and hope He hadn't heard
And wish you hadn't uttered that last loud hasty word.

3. And would you hide the worldly music and put some hymn books out,
Could you let Jesus walk right in or would you rush about.
And I wonder if the Savior spent a day or two with you
Would you go right on saying the things you always say,
Would you go right on doing the things you always do
Would life for you continue as it does from day to day.

4. And would your family conversation keep up its usual face
And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace.
Would you sing the songs you always sing and read the books you read
And let Him know the things on which your mind and spirit feed.
And would you take Jesus with you everywhere you plan to go,
Or maybe you'd change your plans for just a day or so.

5. Would you be glad to have Him meet your very closest friend
Or hope that they would stay away until His visit ends.
Would you be glad to have Him stay forever on and on,
Or would you sigh with great relief when He at last was gone
Oh, it might be interesting to know the things that you would do
If Jesus came in person to spend some time with you.
