1. Through the valley of this life I have wandered,
And I worked for Jesus all along the way;
But now life's evening sun for me is setting,
Lord, I have reached the ending of my way.

Chorus:
Lord, I've been faithful in the service you have given,
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done;
And now my steps are growing weary,
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go home.

2. Looking back upon this life I've lived for Jesus,
I can see how He had helped me all the way;
And the tears I've shed just help to keep me humble,
And each burden only taught me how to pray.

3. Though I hate to leave so many friends behind me,
And the parting of my way's may touch my heart;
But I'll wait for them inside the gate of heaven,
Where the children of God shall never part.
