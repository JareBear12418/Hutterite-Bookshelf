1. 'Tis a story so unkind in the Holy Book we find,
And it tells how Jesus stood alone one day.
False accused and there condemned,
Yet they found no fault with Him.
The man who wore the scarlet purple robe.

Chorus: Purple robe my Savior wore,
Oh the shame for me He bore,
As He stood alone forsaken, on that day.
And they placed upon His head,
Piercing thorns of blood stain red.
His raiment was a scarlet purple robe.

2. In the common judgment hall,
He was mocked and scorned by all.
As the tears of sorrow fell upon His cheek,
Soldiers of the wicked band,
Smote Him with their evil hand
The man who wore the scarlet purple robe.

3. Words of truth, yet no acclaim,
From the lips of Pilate came.
In this man I find no reason He should die.
But the multitude then cried,
'Let Him now be crucified,'
The man who wore the scarlet purple robe.
