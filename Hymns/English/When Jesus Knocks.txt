1. When I was straying out in sin,
My Jesus spoke to me,
His voice I gently heard;
As He said, 'Come unto Me!'
I'll make of you a child of God
And set you free from sin
If you'll open up your heart
And let Him in.

Chorus:
When Jesus knocks, at my heart's door,
I let Him in, He came inside;
And found my heart was stained with sin;
He gave me joy, and peace, this world could never know;
He took my heart and washed it white as fallen snow,
I'm happy now, and other souls I'll help to win,
Since I've opened up my heart
And let Him in.

2. When Jesus knocked at my heart door,
I want Him to stay;
When I accepted Him,
All my burdens rolled away;
And now I know why Jesus died,
Upon the cross for me;
When I opened up my heart
And let Him in.
