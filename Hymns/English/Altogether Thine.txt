1. Nearer yet, O Christ, still nearer
To Thy heart of love,
Lift me higher, knit me closer
To the things above.

2. Fuller still, O Christ, still fuller
Be my joy in Thee;
Stronger ev'ry day, still stronger,
Thy rich grace in me.

3. Clearer yet, O Christ, still clearer,
Be the vision fair
Of the holy, unsoiled garments,
Saints in glory wear.

4. Holier still, O Christ, still holier,
Be my walk below;
Help me onward, raise me upward,
Liker them to grow.

5. Brighter yet, O Christ, still brighter,
I for Thee would shine;
Make me now and make me ever,
Altogether Thine.
