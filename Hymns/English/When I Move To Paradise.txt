1. Soon I'll enter Heavens Land
And with Jesus make my stand.
All my loved ones gone before I'll see.
Not a tear to dim the eye
Not a soul to say goodbye
That will be the final move for me.

Chorus:
When I move to Paradise and view my mansions in the skies
(When I move to Paradise view my mansions in the skies)
That will be the final move I'll ever have to make.
(That will be the final move I'll make.)

2. All our tears down here below
Are a mystery we don't know.
Burdens come and seem to take control.
Then our Lord will take our hand
And will help us understand
When our tears will wash away all pain;

3. Here I bear a heavy load
Walking down life's weary road,
Telling others of His love so free.
But when Jesus calls me home
And my footsteps cease to roam
That will be the final move for me.

Chorus:
After I have done my best reach the home of peace and rest.
(After I have done my best and reach the home of peace and rest.)
That will be the final move I'll ever have to make.
(That will be the final move I'll make.)
