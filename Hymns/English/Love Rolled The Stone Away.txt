He lay there in the darkness all alone and lost
All prepared to face the bitter end.
They had left Him there in pieces, nailed Him to the cross
They knew His heart would never beat again.

CH:Then love (love) rolled away the stone.
And He rose from the ashes where He lay!
His heavenly Father had come to take Him home.
And love (love) rolled the stone away!

The angels gathered round Him, took Him by the hand.
Jesus knew His earthly work was done.
When the gates of heaven opened into the Promised Land,
Glory to the Father and the Son!
