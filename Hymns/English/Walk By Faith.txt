Chorus:
On our own strength we can't make it,
On our own strength we're destined to fall;
On our own strength our ship won't sail,
But with God's help we will prevail.

1. Without Christ in our life we are nothing,
Without him on our side we can't win;
Let's put our faith and our trust in his hands,
Then on the solid rock we can stand.

2. With God in my life I can make it,
With him on my side I can win;
Someday I'll bask in his majesty and glory,
And rejoice with the happy angel band.
