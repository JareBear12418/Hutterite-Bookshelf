1. I was there when you drew the breath of life;
And I heard your voice the first time that you cried.
And though you couldn't see me I was very near,
And there's something now that I want you to hear:

Chorus: You will always be a child in my eyes;
And when you need some love, my arms are open wide.
Even when you're growing old, I hope you realize,
You will always be a child in my eyes.

2. I was there the first time that you prayed,
And I heard all the promises you made;
And when you fell before me crying, 'Father, I have sinned,'
I picked you up and held you close again.
