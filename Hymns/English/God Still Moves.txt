Chorus
God still moves, God still moves
In the hearts of people God still moves
He does not sleep, nor does He slumber
God still moves, God still moves

1. They've prayed for this moment,
since the day He said 'Good-by.'
He said He'd never come back home,
but God has heard their cry
They'll have a sweet reunion, as they lift their voice in praise
For the work of God has done, now their hearts can truly say.
(Repeat Chorus)

2. It's gonna take some time for all their wounds to heal
But the work will be completed as they gave away their wills
To the one who is able now to change the hearts of man
He has done it through the ages He can do it once again
(repeat chorus twice)
