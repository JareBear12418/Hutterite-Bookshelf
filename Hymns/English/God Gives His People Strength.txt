If we but trust in His word,
Our pray'rs are always heard
He warmly welcomes anyone who's erred:
God gives His people hope.

If we but open wide our heart,
He's sure to do His part
He's always the first to make a start:

When sorrow fills us to the brim
And courage grows dim,
He lays to rest our restlessness in Him:
