1. I hear the sweetest singing
Coming from the land across the distant shore,
Sweetest harmony, a melody I've never heard before;
Music like the sound of many waters
A million voices piercing through the sky,
It must be the angels rehearsing for the banquet
Making preparations for the wedding in the sky,

Chorus: And I wonder if the angels could use another singer,
I'd like to join the chorus
when they gather 'round God's throne;
When my body's new and my voice is strong
Maybe I can sing along,
I wonder if the angels could use another singer.

2. I hear those silver trumpets, violins playing symphony,
They are contemplating celebrating the crowing of the king
Maybe I could join them in the morning
Just before the breaking of the dawn;
I have an invitation to join the celebration,
Swing wide the pearly gates
There's a singer coming home.
