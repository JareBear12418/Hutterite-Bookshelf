Holy spirit, faithful guide
Ever hear the Christan sigh
Gently lead us by the hand
Pilgrims in a desert land
Weary souls forever rejoice
While they hear that sweetest voice.

Whisper softly 'Wand'rer come
Follow me, I'll guide thee home!'

Ever present, truest friend
Ever near, thy aid to lend
leave us not to doubt and fear
Groping on in darkness drear
When the storms are raging sore
Hearts grow faint and hopes give 'oer

Whisper softly 'Wand'rer come
Follow me, I'll guide thee home!'

When our days of toil shall cease
Waiting still for sweet release
Nothing left but heav'n and prayer
Knowing that our names are there
Wading deep a dismal flood
Bleeding not', but Jesus blood

Whisper softly 'Wand'rer come
Follow me, I'll guide thee home!'
