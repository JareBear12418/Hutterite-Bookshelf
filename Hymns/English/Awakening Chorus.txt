Chorus:

1. Awake! (Awake!) awake! (awake!) and sing the blessed story;
Awake! (Awake!) awake! (awake!) and let your song of praise arise;
Awake! (Awake!) awake! (awake!) the earth is full of glory,
And light is beam - ing from the radiant skies;
(And light is beaming)
The rocks and rills, the vales and hills resound with gladness,
All nature joins to sing the triumph song.
The Lord Jehovah reigns and sin is backward hurled!

Chorus:
Rejoice, rejoice! Lift heart and voice; Jehovah reigns!
Proclaim His sov'reign pow'r to all the world;

And let His glo - rious banner be unfurled!
(And let the grand and glorious banner be unfurled!)
Je - ho - vah reigns!
(Jehovah reigns! Jehavah reigns!)
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) rejoice!(rejoice!)rejoice!(rejoice!) Jehovah reigns!

2. Ring out! (Ring out!) ring out! (ring out!) O bells of joy and gladness!
Repeat, (repeat,) repeat, (repeat,) anew the story o'er again,
Till all (Till all) the earth (the earth) shall lose its weight of sadness,
And shout anew the glorious refrain;
(And shout anew)
With angels in the heights sing of the great salvation
He wrested from the hand of sin and death.
The Lord Jehovah reigns and sin is backward hurled!
