1. Gracious Father, up in heaven,
Bless the love we've pledged to share;
Ever lead our faltering footsteps,
Guide and tend us everywhere;
For we know, dear Lord, without thee,
We would surely lose the way;
Therefore, Father, be thou near us,
Keep us each and every day.

2. May your love shine down upon us,
May thy peace attend our way;
Let us not forget to thank you,
For the joys you send each day;
But should come some grief and sadness,
Disappointment, pain and tears;
May our faith in thee grow stronger,
Knowing thou art ever near.

3. Help us live for good of others,
Ever leading souls to you;
Ever lead us in green pastures,
And beside the winding stream;
Ever following thy footsteps,
Ever walking in thy way;
Till at last in heaven we praise thee,
This our prayer, dear Lord, Amen.
