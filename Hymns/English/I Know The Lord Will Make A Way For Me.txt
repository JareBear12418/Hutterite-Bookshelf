1. I know the Lord will make a way for me,
I know the Lord will make a way for me,
If I live a holy life, shun the wrong and do the right;
I know the Lord will make a way for me.

2. I want the Lord to have His way with me,
I want the Lord to have His way with me,
Though the need be great or small, I would yield to Him my all;
I want the Lord to have His way with me.
