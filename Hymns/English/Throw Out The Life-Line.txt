1. Throw out the Lifeline across the dark wave,
There is a brother whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother! oh, who then, will dare
To throw out the Lifeline, his peril to share?

Chorus:
Throw out the Lifeline! Throw out the Lifeline!
Someone is drifting away;
Throw out the Lifeline! Throw out the Lifeline!
Someone is sinking today.

2. Throw out the Lifeline with hand quick and strong;
Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; oh; hasten today
And out with the Lifeboat! away, then, away!

3. Throw out the Lifeline to danger fraught men,
Sinking in anguish where you've never been:
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.

4. Soon will the season of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift to eternity's shore,
Haste then, my brother, no time for delay,
But throw out the Lifeline and save them today.
