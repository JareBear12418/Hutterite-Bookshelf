1. Oh, lend me a hand, please Lord, and guide me,
And help lead me down the road that is right;
Oh, carry me through these hours of darkness,
And show me the path of shining light.

Chorus:
I'm a wandering soul, I'm lost from my Savior,
A sheep that has strayed so far from the fold;
Just atearing alone in the clutch of old Satan
But I'm hoping someday You'll save my soul.

2. Dear Lord, please forgive the grief I have caused you,
But thought of my sins, it torches my soul;
Oh, help me to know the joy of salvation,
That blends my life through and makes me whole.
