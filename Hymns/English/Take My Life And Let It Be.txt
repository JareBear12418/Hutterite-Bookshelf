1. Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated Lord, to thee;
Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of thy love.

2. Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for thee;
Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only for my King.

3. Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

4. Take my will and make it thine,
It shall be no longer mine;
Take my heart, it is thine own,
It shall be thy royal throne.

5. Take my love; my Lord,
I pour at thy feet its treasure store;
Take myself and I will be
Ever, only, all for thee.

6. Lord, I give my life to thee,
Thine forevermore to be;
Lord, I give my life to thee,
Thine forevermore to be.
