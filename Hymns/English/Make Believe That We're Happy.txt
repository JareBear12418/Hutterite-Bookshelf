Make believe that we're happy.
Make believe that it's true.
Make believe you have me.
I'll make believe I have you;
We'll make believe that we can make it come true.

You belong to another;
I belong to someone too.
But you can't seem to see,
That our love just has to be.
We'll make believe that we can make it come true.

Maybe some day up above
They'll understand our kind of love.
We know love like ours is real.
I know just the way you feel.
We'll make believe that we can make it come true.
