1. Last night as I lay sleeping this dream came to me,
I dreamed about the end of time, about eternity,
I saw a million sinners fall on their knees and pray,
The Savior sadly shook His head and this I heard Him say;
'Sorry I never knew you, depart from me forevermore,
Sorry I never knew you, go and serve the one you served before.'

2. I thought the time had come when I must stand the trial,
I told the Lord that I had been a Christian all the while;
So through the book He then looked, but sadly shook His head,
They placed me over on His left, and this is what He said:
'Sorry I never knew you, I find no record of your birth,
Sorry I never knew you, go and serve the one you served while on earth.'

3. There was my wife and children, I heard each one's voice,
They must have all been happy, it seemed they did rejoice.
With robes of white around them and crowns upon their heads,
My little girl looked up to me and this is what she said:
'Daddy, we can't go with you, we must stay on this lovely shore,
Sorry, for we still love you, but you cannot be our daddy anymore.'

3. When I from sleep awakened, with tears in my eyes,
I looked around and there about me to my great surprise;
I saw my wife and babies and knew I had a dream
So down beside my bed I fell and for mercy did I scream:
'Father, who art in glory, in mercy look on me today
Forgive me, let serve Thee, 'til the summons comes and calls me away.'
