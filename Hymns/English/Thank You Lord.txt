1. As the world looks upon me and I struggle along
They say I have nothing but they are so wrong
In my heart I'm rejoicing, Though' the world may not see
Thank you. Lord, for your blessings on me.

Chorus. There's a roof up above me, I've a good place to sleep
There's food on my table and shoes on my feet
You gave me your love. Lord, and a fine family
Thank you, Lord, for your blessings on me.

2 .Now I know I'm not wealthy, and my shoes they're not new
And I don't have much money, but. Lord, I have you
And to me that's all that matters, Though' the world may not see
Thank you. Lord, for your blessings on me.
