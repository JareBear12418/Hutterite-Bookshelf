1. Praise God with singing, come join in youthful chorus
For gladly He hears us send praise to heaven ringing,
Praise God with singing, praise God with singing.

2. Let songs ring on high Thy holiness to honor,
The echoes reply, from youthful hearts together,
Thy children be nigh, Thy children be nigh.

3. Let praises resound, with hearts and voices singing,
Let songs abound, to highest heaven bringing,
Our thanks profound, our thanks profound.

4. We gather here below, yet thou in mercy hearest,
The honor we owe, the name we hold the dearest,
Our praises o'er flow, our praises o'er flow.

5. Soon comes the time, when songs a thousand fold,
Oh, hour sublime, praise Thee as was fortold,
Forevermore, forevermore.
