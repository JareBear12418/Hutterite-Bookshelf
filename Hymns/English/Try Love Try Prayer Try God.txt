1. When it seems that the world is on your shoulders,
While sinking beneath the hill you try to climb;
Just ask the Lord to come and be your Savior,
And He will climb with you all the time.

Chorus: Try God (try God)
when the way grows weary that you trod,
Try Prayer (try Prayer)
when the load is heavy that you bear.
Let's try Love (try Love)
show the world around us that we care,
Let's try Love, try Prayer, try God.

2. He set my feet on higher ground,
A friend like no other in Him I have found;
He lifted me when I was down,
And by His grace, I'm heaven bound.
