1. Not long ago I was thinking of home,
And wondered if mama was there all alone;
I'd thought I'd drop by as I'd done before,
But the sound from within made me stop at the door.

2. She was praying, a sound that the world seldom hears,
Praying, her words were pleading and clear;
The sound of her voice as she spoke my name,
Brought tears to my eyes, my heart filled with shame,
Praying, praying for someone like me.

3. I was walking one night and I felt so alone,
My heart was weary of the troubles I'd known;
I hadn't noticed a church that was near,
Till the sound from within, seemed to fill the air.

4. They were praying, a sound that the world seldom hears,
Praying, for children that God loves so dear;
I stood in the darkness, I could not see,
But I could picture them down on their knees,
Praying, praying for someone like me.
