When I'm low in spirit, I cry, Lord, lift me up.
I want to go higher with Thee.
But the Lord knows I can't stay on a mountain,
So He picked out a valley for me.

CH:He leads me beside still waters
Somewhere in the valley below.
He draws me aside to be tested and tried.
But in the valley, He restoreth my soul.

It's dark as a dungeon and the sun seldom shines.
And I question, Lord, why must it be?
And He tells me that there's strength in my sorrows.
And there's victory in trials for me.
