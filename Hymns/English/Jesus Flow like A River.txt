1. You are the river of life, you are the joy of my soul!
You are the raging river out of control!
Riding the waves of your glory,
to depths of joy I've not known!
Release a deeper flooding in my soul. (in my soul)

Chorus: Jesus, flow like a river!
(And it's) Deeper than the sea in me!
Take me to the deepest ocean of your heart and let me go
Plunge me deeper let your living waters flow. (waters flow)

2. Never a river so peaceful, never a river so pure!
Never have I known cleansing, so deep and so sure!
Never a river so peaceful, while raging out of control,
But now I have found what satisfies my soul. (in my soul)
