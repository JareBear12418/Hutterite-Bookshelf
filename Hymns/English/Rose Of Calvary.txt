1. Many are the lovely flowers blooming with delight,
Many are the joys of living when you're living right;
Love is growing, just in knowing, someone cares for me;
In my heart this rose is blooming: Rose of Calvary.

Chorus: Share a blessing, so refreshing, fragrant flowers grow,
Lovely thoughts and words and actions, everywhere you go.
Share the fairest; share the rarest, for the world to see,
Lovely Rose of Sharon blooming: Rose of Calvary.

2. Heaven's fragrance, lovely flowers, Lamb of God divine,
Lovely Rose of Sharon dying for your sins and mine;
Love so pure, and so refreshing, given full and free-
Crushed and broken, bruised and bleeding: Rose of Calvary.

3. Many wounded hearts are bleeding, crying in despair.
Many are the lost and lonely burdened down with care;
Who will share the lovely flowers, for someone to see?
Tell them of the Rose of Sharon: Rose of Calvary.

4. When you want to reach somebody, show them that you care,
Say it with a lovely flower, fragrant and so rare,
Such a lovely, kind expression let it always be,
From the heart this lovely witness: Rose of Calvary.
