1. If I speak in tongues of men or angels,
And have no love and have no love,
I am a noisy gong or clanging cymbal,
Without love, without love.

Chorus: Love is patient and kind, slow to anger,
Love delights in truth;
There is nothing that love cannot face,
And love endures, love endures.

2. If I have the gift of prophecy,
And know every hidden truth,
Or have faith strong enough to move mountains,
Without love, what is the use?

3. Are there prophets, their work will be over
Are there tongues, their voice will cease
Is there knowledge, it too will pass away
Only love lives eternally.

4. There are three things that last forever
Out of all I'm singing of:
There is faith and hope and charity,
But the greatest of these is love.
