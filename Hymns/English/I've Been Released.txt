1. Sometime ago I lived a life of sorrow,
Sometime ago my life was misery;
But then one day the blessed Savior found me
He loosened those chains and set me free from sin.

Chorus:
I've been released those prison doors have opened,
I've been released my soul has been set free;
No more do those chains of sins now hold me
For Christ has given to me the victory.

2. O yes, today my soul is still rejoicing
Because of Christ who bled and died for me
T'was on the cross He broke those chains that held me
And now I'll live for Him eternally.

3. Dear friends today, is your life filled with sorrow?
And do you find there is no peace within;
Just come to Christ for He alone can save you,
He'll take those chains and set you free from sin.
