1. Listen to the blessed invitation,
Sweeter than the notes of angelsong,
Chiming softly with a heav'nly cadence,
Calling to the passing throng.

Chorus:
'Him that cometh unto Me, (unto Me,)
Him that cometh unto Me, (unto Me,)
Him that cometh unto Me, (unto Me,)
I will in no wise cast out.'

2. Weary toiler, sad and heavy laden,
Joyfully the great salvation see;
Close beside thee stands the Burden Bearer,
Strong to bear thy load and thee.

3. Come, ye thirsty, to the living waters,
Hungry, come and on His bounty feed;
Not thy fitness is the plea to bring Him,
But thy pressing utmost need.

4. Coming humbly, daily to this Savior,
Breathing all the heart to Him in prayer;
Coming someday to the heav'nly mansions,
He will give thee welcome there.
