1. Years of time have come and gone since I first heard it told,
How Jesus would come again some day;
If back then it seemed so real, then I just can't help but feel
How much closer His coming is today.

Chorus:
Signs of the times are ev'rywhere,
And there's a brand new feeling in the air;
Keep your eyes upon the eastern sky,
Lift up your head, redemption draweth nigh.

2. Wars and strife on ev'ry hand, and violence fills our land,
Still some people doubt He'll come again;
But the Word of God is true, He'll redeem His chosen few,
Don't lose hope, soon Christ Jesus will descend.
