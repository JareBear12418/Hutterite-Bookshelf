1. I'm thinking of a little lady,
She bears her load without a fret;
The one who rocked me in my cradle,
And through the years she loves me yet.

2. The roses on her cheeks are faded,
And when they pass her on the street;
Would break my heart to see them mock her,
Although she may not dress so neat.

Chorus:
She was the first to ever love me,
The first to hold me to her breast;
God bless her cause she is my mother,
And she'll be the last one I'll forget.

3. Her ways may seem a bit old fashioned
And some may laugh when passing by;
I'm not ashamed to call her Mother
My love for her I'll ne'er deny.

4. Each lock of gray tells of her sorrow
As day by day she's growing old;
Her tender smile each day grows sweeter,
Each day she's closer to God's fold.
