1. Kneels at the feet of His friends,
Silently washed their feet:
Master who acts as a slave to them.

Chorus:
Jesu, (Jesu,) Jesu, (Jesu,)
Fill us with your love,
Show us how to serve
The neighbors we have from you.

2. Neighbors are rich and poor
Neighbors are black and white,
Neighbors are nearby and faraway.

3. Loving puts us on our knees,
Serving as though we are slaves,
This is the way we should live for you.
