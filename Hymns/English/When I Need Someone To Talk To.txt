Chorus:
When I need (when I need) someone to talk to,
Oh, anytime (anytime) I need a friend,
I can pray (I can pray) to you, my Jesus,
And then I feel (and then I feel) alright again.

1. Jesus thank-you for each day, that you help me thru;
Without your love I don't know what I'd do.
And thank-you for each breath of life,
Each miracle from you;
And thanks for taking time for me,
When I need someone to talk to.

2. Sometimes I feel so alone, I don't know what to do,
When loneliness is just too much to bear;
When hope is gone, no one's around,
My heart is broke in two.
Lord, I know you're always there
When I need someone to talk to.
