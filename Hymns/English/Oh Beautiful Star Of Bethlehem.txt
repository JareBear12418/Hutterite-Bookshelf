1. Oh, beautiful Star, of Bethlehem,
Shining afar thro' shadows dim,
Giving a light for those who long have gone; (have gone;)
And guiding the wisemen on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay,
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on. (shine on.)

Chorus:
Oh beautiful Star of Bethlehem,
(Beautiful, beautiful Star, Star of Bethlehem,)
Shine upon us until the glory dawn; (glory dawn;)
Oh, give us Thy light to light the way
Into the land of perfect day,
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on. (shine on.)
2.
Oh, beautiful Star, the hope of light,
Guiding the pilgrim thro' the night,
Over the mountain till the break of dawn; (the dawn;)
And into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray,
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on. (shine on.)

3. Oh, beautiful Star, the hope of rest,
For the redeemed, the good and blest,
Yonder in glory when the crown is won; (is won;)
For Jesus is now that Star divine,
Brighter and brighter He will shine.
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on. (shine on.)
