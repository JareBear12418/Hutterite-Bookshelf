This, this I pray from thee o' God.
Not the quiet of the grave,
The silence of the sod.
But rest in thee, tranquility

Quiet and peace, this day this hour.
Strength and blessing will increase,
The holy spirit power
Not rest from care, but peace in prayer.

Rest and release, not rest from toil
That I may forever cease
From live with its turmoil
Calm and content, when strength is found.

Peace, voice, and power, the holy hush.
Of the twilight's growing hour
The evening song of thrush
Courage and calm, In prayer and song.
