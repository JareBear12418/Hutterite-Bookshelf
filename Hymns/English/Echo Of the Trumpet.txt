1. Somewhere in the heaven
There's a banquet table spread,
Preparations being made to receive the bride;
While Gabriel is the trumpet
For the sound to wake the dead,
And the signal for that final glory ride.

Chorus:
When I hear the trumpet sound
With the saints I'll leave the ground,
What rejoicing that will be on that great day;
And what glory we will share,
While we're sailing through the air
As the echo of the trumpet fades away.

2. As those heaven gates swing open
And our loved one's gather 'round,
There's a feeling of excitement everywhere;
There will be a great reunion
When we're lifted from the ground,
As the echo of the trumpets fills the air.
