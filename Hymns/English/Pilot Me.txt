1. Although I cannot see the way
O'er life's tempestuous sea
I know that Jesus is my friend
And that He'll pilot me.

Chorus: He'll pilot me
By His hand He'll pilot me
From day to day
Over life's tempestuous sea
When blinded eyes can't see the way
When my blinded eyes can't see,
cannot see the way, the way
Then come what may
Come what may, come what may
On life's dark sea
On life's dark and stormy sea
My blessed Lord will pilot me.
My dear Lord, blessed Lord, He will pilot, pilot me.

2. Dark clouds may gather in the sky
And rough the sea may be
His love shall ever be my song
I know He'll pilot me.

3. Dear Lord, whate'er the storm may be
I'll simply trust in thee
Relying on thy love so true
To safely pilot me.
