1. For so many years my life was a song
Of changes that never lasted long;
An endless tune of tangled melodies,
Sung by a heart that was not free, not free.

Chorus:
I'm in sweet harmony
Harmony with Jesus, my King,
No more lonely songs to sing
With Jesus as my King,
I'm in sweet harmony.

2. If I started singing the lyrics to my life,
They would be of sadness and sorrow;
With the Lord in my life, I sing a joyful song,
And the joy will remain forever, and ever.
