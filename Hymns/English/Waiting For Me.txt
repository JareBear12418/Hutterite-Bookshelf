When I shall cross over the dark growing tide,
Oh what a glad meeting there'll be!
For close by the beautiful pearly white gate,
My loved ones are waiting for me.

CH: Waiting for me, (Waiting for me,)
They're waiting for me. (Waiting for me.)
Oh, what a glad meeting there'll be!
Waiting for me, (waiting for me,)
They're waiting for me. (Waiting for me.)
My loved ones are waiting for me.

Sometimes I get weary and long to go home.
But all of my work is not done.
I'm glad I can labour for Jesus my Lord,
Till sounds the sweet message, 'Come Home.'
