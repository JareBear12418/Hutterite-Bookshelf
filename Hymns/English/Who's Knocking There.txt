1. Who's knocking there?
O two poor people are here.
What do you want?
A shelter for the night.
For the love of God we ask Thee,
Open now thy door in pity.
O no, no, no!
O force us not to go!
It must be so.
Our thanks to thee we'll show.
No it cannot be I fear, So now be off you'll not stay here!

2. Who's at the door?
A wife and husband poor.
What do you wish?
Hear what we ask of thee.
Give us, please, tonight a lodging.
God will surely give His blessing.
What will you pay?
We have no money more.
Then get you gone!
O please do open the door.
I'll have no disturbance here so now be gone be off somewhere!

3. Why do you weep?
Our limbs are cold and numb.
That I can't help?
O give us, please, a room.
Ev'rywhere we are rejected,
Ev'ry door to us is bolted.
Then stay outside.
Please open! Please be kind!
I cannot help.
A shelter we must find.
Go on to the place next door I have no room so ask no more.

4. Now you be gone?
But friend where shall we stay.
The stables there.
Go Joseph lead the way.
Child of mine God's will is shown us.
That the poverty now knowest.
Come now be off.
O hard words hard words sure.
Out to the stall.
A place so mean and poor.
Aye the place is good enough You don't need much so now be off.

5. Come sinner here
O listen ev'ryone.
Yes, come right here,
And see what you have done.
From you heart you've driven Jesus,
Closed the door to him who frees us.
Now sinner weep.
The little Jesus sweet.
Today O grief.
In stable cold must sleep!
O how cruel is the sin that will not let the Christchild in!
