1. As my Savior was led up to Calvary's hill,
All the birds stopped their singing
And the leaves stood still,
All the flowers in the fields
Bowed their lovely heads,
As my Savior to Calvary was lead.

Chorus:
Tell me why, oh, tell me why,
Did Jesus die on Calvary?
Tell me why did He suffer such agony?
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son,
And that is why Jesus died for you and me.

2. They put nails in His hands, pierced His precious side,
And the pain was so great
That tears filled His eyes
Yet He spoke not a word,
Till that last breath He drew,
Then He prayed they know not what they do.
