1. If you asked about my fortune
And would like to hear me boast,
If your looking for my glory
And the things I treasure most.
Then I'll have to tell the story
Of the one, who makes me sing,
He's my Savior, He's my brother,
He's my king.

Chorus:
I love my Jesus, I love my Jesus,
And my love for Him grows stronger day by day;
If you ask me I will always answer,
I love my Jesus, and Jesus loves me, too.

2. When I stand there on that morning
And my journey is complete
When I see the face of Jesus,
And I bow down at His feet.
Maybe I will not be able,
To say much or give a speech,
But there's one thing I surely will repeat.
I love my Jesus, I love my Jesus,
Thank-You Jesus, Savior of my soul;
On that morning I won't wait to tell you,
I love you Jesus, I know you love me, too.
