God's way is best; if human wisdom
A fairer way may seem to show,
'Tis only that our earth-dimmed vision
The truth can never clearly know.

Refrain:
God's way is best, I will not murmur,
Although the end I may not see;
Where'er He leads I'll meekly follow,
God's way is best, is best for me.

Had I the choosing of my pathway,
In blindness I should go astray,
And wander far away in darkness,
Nor reach that land of endless day.

He leadeth true; I will not question,
Though through the valley I shall go;
Though I should pass through clouds of trial,
And drink the cup of human woe.

God's way is best; heart, cease thy struggling
To see and know and understand;
Forsake thy fears and doubts, but trusting,
Submit thyself into His hand.

Thy way is best, so lead me onward,
My all I give to Thy control;
Thy loving hand will truly guide me,
And safe to glory bring my soul.
