1. Hear ye the Master's call,
'Give Me thy best!'
For, be it great or small
That is His test.
Do then the best you can,
Not for reward,
Not for the praise of man,
But for the Lord.

Chorus:
Ev'ry work for Jesus will be blest,
But He asks ev'ryone his best.
Our talents may be few,
These may be small,
But unto Him is due
Our best, our all.

2. Wait not for men to laud,
Heed not their slight;
Winning the smile of God
Brings it delight!
Aiding the good and true
Ne'er goes unblest,
All that we think or do,
Be it the best.

3. Night soon comes on apace,
Day hastens by;
Workman and work must face
Testing on high.
O may we in that day
Find rest, sweet rest,
Which God has promised those
Who do their best.
