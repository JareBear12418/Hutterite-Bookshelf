1. He came to earth a long time ago,
Who did? Jesus did!
He gave His life to save our souls,
Who did? Jesus did!

Chorus: Jesus came to save all men,
We know He did!
He made a promise to come back again,
Who did? Jesus did!

2. He said be ready to go with Him,
Who did? Jesus did!
He gave you a light, don't let it grow dim.
Who did? Jesus did!

3. He came before to save us from sin,
Who did? Jesus did!
He said, 'Follow me, and be fishers of men.'
Who did? Jesus did!
