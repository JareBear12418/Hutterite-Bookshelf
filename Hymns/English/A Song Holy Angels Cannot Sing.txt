1. Angels never knew the joy that is mine,
For Thy blood has never washed their sins away;
Though they sing in heaven there will come a time
When silently they'll listen to me sing, 'Amazing Grace'.

Chorus:
Its a song holy angels cannot sing,
'Amazing Grace' how sweet Thy sound;
It's a song holy angels cannot sing,
I once was lost but now I'm found.

2. And holy is the Lord the Angels sing
All around the throne of God continually;
For me to join their song will be a natural thing,
But they just don't know the words to 'Love Lifted Me'.
