1. Sometimes the cares of life come pressing 'round me,
Fears of tomorrow tend to make me frown,
But then I pray, 'Oh Lord, please come and help me,
Don't let my fears and worries get me down.'

Chorus:
'Help me to leave tomorrow with you,
Jesus, So many things I cannot understand,
And when dark waves of fear would dash about me,
Help me to leave tomorrow in your hand.'

2. I cannot see beyond this fleeting moment,
The days ahead are hidden in God's plan,
'Help me, oh Lord, to trust your constant leading,
And in that confidence to always stand.'

3. The past is gone, tomorrow is uncertain,
'Lord, take my hand and lead me safely on,
Until the cares of this short life are over,
Until the day of heaven's glorious dawn.'
