1. As the deer pants for the water
So my soul longs after you.
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship you.

Chorus:
You alone are my strength, my shield,
To you alone may my spirit yield.
You alone are my heart's desire,
And I long to worship you.

2. I want you more than gold or silver,
Only you can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy-giver,
And the apple of my eye.
