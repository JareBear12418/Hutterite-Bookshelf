1. There's a place of dazzling beauty,
No human eye has ever seen;
With gates of pearl and streets paved with gold.
It's a land of milk and honey, oh! it's more than just a dream;
It's the land of life beyond the crystal sea.

Chorus: It's the land of life, where living is forever,
Where the sting of death will claim no victory.
We are nothing more, than just a passing shadow,
Till we reach the land of living beyond the crystal sea.

2. The sun is nothing but a legend
In this paradise of dreams;
The Lamb will be the only light we need.
Its soothing walls of jasper, built by hands unseen;
It's the land of life beyond the crystal sea.
