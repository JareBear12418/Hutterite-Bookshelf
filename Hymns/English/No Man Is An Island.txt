Chorus:
No man is an island,
No man stands alone,
Each man's joy is joy to me,
Each man's grief is my own;
We need one another,
So I will defend,
Each man as my brother,
Each man as my friend.

1. 1. saw the people gather,
I heard the music start;
The song they were singing,
Is ringing in my heart.

2. The song they were singing,
Rang out with peace and joy;
And filled my heart with gladness,
That no one can destroy.

3. The earth is filled with bloodshed,
With sorrow, grief and pain;
But a new day soon is coming,
When man shall sing again.
