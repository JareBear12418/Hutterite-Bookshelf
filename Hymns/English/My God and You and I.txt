1. We've been traveling down this road for years
Sharing grief and heartaches and tears
Lifting and helping burdens to bear
Yes it's my God and you who always care.

Chorus: Our hearts are holding hands so true
Nobody knows the talks I've shared with you
Filling my mind with dreams so fair
I thank you God you two are there.

3. My thanks my God to you I humbly bring
For giving me my friend so faithfully
Each word and smile He sends upon my way
I thank you God yes I thank you everyday.
