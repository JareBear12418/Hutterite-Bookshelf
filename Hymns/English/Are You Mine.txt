Are you mine all life through?
Will you kiss me when I'm blue?
Will you whisper 'I love you'?
And make all my dreams come true?
Will you share the good and bad?
Bring me joy when I am sad?
Tell me darling are you mine and only mine?

CH:Are you mine?  Yes, I am!
All the time?  Yes, I am! Mine alone?  Yessiree!
And all my own?  Yessiree!
No one else will ever do,
I'll be yours and I'll be true,
Don't worry dear, have no fear
Cause I'm yours.

Are you mine tell me dear?
Will I always have you near?
Will your love light always shine
In your heart just like in mine?
Will you give as well as take?
Will you keep the vows you make?
Tell me darling, are you mine and only mine?

Are you mine rich or poor?
Tell me darling are you sure?
Will you whisper 'Yes, I do'?
And forever love me true?
Will you honour and obey?
Will you promise not to stray?
Tell me darling, are you mine and only mine?
