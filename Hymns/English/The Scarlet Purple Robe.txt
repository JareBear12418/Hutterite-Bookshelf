1. Tis a story so unkind,
In the Holy Book we find
And it tells how Jesus stood alone one day;
False accused and there condemned,
Yet they found no fault in Him,
The man that wore the scarlet purple robe.

Chorus:
Purple robe my Savior wore;
Oh, the shame for me He bore!
As He stood alone forsaken on that day
And they placed upon His head
Piercing thorns of blood stained red;
His raiment was the scarlet purple robe.

2. In a common judgment hall,
He was mocked and scorned by all,
While the tears of sorrow fell upon His cheek;
Soldiers of the wicked band
Smote Him with an evil hand,
The man that wore the scarlet purple robe.

3. Words of truth, yet no acclaim,
From the lips of Pilate came
'In this man I find no reason He should die,'
But the multitude still cried;
'Let Him now be crucified'
The man that wore the scarlet purple robe.
