1. We cannot, of course all be handsome,
And it's hard for us all to be good;
We are sure now and then to be lonely,
And we don't always do as we should.

2. To be patient is not always easy,
To be cheerful is much harder still;
But at least we can always be pleasant,
If we make up our minds that we will.

3. And it pays every time to be friendly,
Although you feel worried or blue;
If you smile at the world and look cheerful,
The world will soon smile back at you.

4. So try to brace up and look pleasant,
No matter how low you are down;
Good humor is always contagious,
But you banish your friends when you frown.
