1. Who at my door is standing,
Patiently drawing near,
Entrance within demanding?
Who is the voice I hear?

Chorus:
Sweetly the tones are falling:
Open the door for me!
If thou will heed My calling,
I will abide with thee.

2. Lonely without He's standing
Lonely within am I;
While I am still delaying,
Will He not pass me by?

3. All thru the dark hours dreary,
Knocking again is He;
Jesus, art Thou not weary,
Waiting so long for me?

4. Door of my heart, I hasten!
Thee will I open wide;
Though He rebuke and chasten,
He shall with me abide.
