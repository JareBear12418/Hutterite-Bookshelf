1. Like a tiny rosebud, on a burning desert sand,
Fiery winds toss their petals at the least command,
Just like a rosebud, many times, my thirsty soul had cried,
And he satisfied, he satisfied.

Chorus:
Now there are wells of living water flowing all along the way,
Sparkling crystal waters from the land of endless day,
Cooling showers from a place where souls will never die,
And he satisfies, he satisfies.

2. Like a child away from loved ones, who is lost in darkest night,
Searching for their way back home; their heart is filled with fright.
That's how I was away from God, my searching spirit cried,
And he satisfies, he satisfies.
