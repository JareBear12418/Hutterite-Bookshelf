1. Create in me a clean heart oh God
And renew a right spirit within me
Create in me a clean heart oh God
And renew a right spirit within me.

2. Cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord
And take not thy Holy Spirit from me
Restore unto me the joy of thy Salvation
And renew a right spirit within me.
