1. Don't say that you Love Him
Then live like you don't
You think they'll believe you?
I tell You They won't.
Don't think that this World,
Is made up of fools
They're watching your light,
Do you live by the rules?

2. Don't say that He's very, important to you
When everything else, dominates what you do.
They'll never believe you, unless they can see
Your words and your live, together agree.

Chorus:
So just live, what you say
Show them that Jesus, is truly the way
Just live, what you say
Someone is watching your light today.

3. So be an example, in all that you do
Show them that Jesus is living in you
Speak of His power and love everyday
Live like you mean it and show them the way.
