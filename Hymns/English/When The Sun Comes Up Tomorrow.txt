1. When the sun comes up tomorrow,
Lord, I'll be praising you;
I'll always give you glory,
In everything I do.
Although the storm clouds gather,
Or should the skies be blue.
When the sun comes up tomorrow,
Lord, I'll be praising you!

2. You took my sins to Calvary,
And died that I might live;
I know that, I'm not worthy,
Of the blessings that you give;
I know that you still love me,
And Lord, I love you too.
When the sun comes up tomorrow,
Lord, I'll be praising you!

3. It may be on the mountain,
Or in the valley low;
I may be free from heartaches,
Or burdened as I go.
Until my journey's ended,
And my life on earth is through;
When the sun comes up tomorrow,
Lord, I'll be praising you!
