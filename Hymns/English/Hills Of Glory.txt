1. Oh, what glory awaits me
In heaven's bright city
When I'll get there such sights I'll behold.
A million scenes of her beauty
Will be there that I'll view them
Still Jesus will outshine them all.

Chorus: Mansions will glisten on the hills of glory,
Happy reunion on streets of gold
Angel choirs singing glad praises forever
But Jesus will outshine them all.

2. The sparking river is flowing
Happy faces all glowing,
Mid the splendor where night never falls
The golden glass gives reflection
To that city's perfection
Still Jesus will outshine them all.
