1. There's a story old that has often been told,
Of how our dear Savior died,
As they nailed His hands
He cried, 'They don't understand'
As the blood flowed from His side.

Chorus:
How can you refuse Him now,
How can you refuse Him now,
How can you turn away from His side;
With tears in His eyes
On the cross there He died,
How can you refuse Jesus now?

2. As He hung there on the tree,
He prayed for you and me,
There was no one His pain to ease;
Before He died, He faintly cried,
'Father, forgive them please.'
