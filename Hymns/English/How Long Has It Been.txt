1. How long has it been since you talked with the Lord
And told Him your heart's hidden secrets?
How long since you prayed? how long since you stayed
On your knees till the light shone through?
How long has it been since your mind felt at ease?
How long since your heart knew no burden?
Can you call Him your friend?
How long has it been since you knew that He cared for you?

2. How long has it been since you knelt by your bed
And prayed to the Lord up in heaven?
How long since you knew that He'd answer you,
And would keep you the long night through?
How long has it been since you woke with the dawn,
And felt that the day's worth the living?
Can you call Him your friend?
How long has it been since you knew that He cared for you?
