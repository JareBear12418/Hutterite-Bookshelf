1. There's a call comes ringing o'er the restless wave,
'Send the light! (Send the light!)
Send the light!' (Send the light!)
There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save,
Send the light! (Send the light!)
Send the light! (Send the light!)

Chorus: Send the light! the blessed gospel light;
(Send the light! the blessed gospel light,)
Let it shine from shore to shore!
(Let it shine from shore to shore!)
Send the light! the blessed gospel light;
(Send the light! the blessed gospel light,)
Let it shine forever more!
(Let it shine forever more!)

2. We have heard the Macedonian call today,
'Send the light! (Send the light!)
Send the light!' (Send the light!)
And a golden off'ring at the cross we lay,
Send the light! (Send the light!)
Send the light! (Send the light!)

3. Let us pray that grace may ev'rywhere abound,
Send the light! (Send the light!)
Send the light! (Send the light!)
And a Christ like Spirit ev'rywhere be found,
Send the light! (Send the light!)
Send the light! (Send the light!)

4. Let us not grow weary in the work of love,
Send the light! (Send the light!)
Send the light! (Send the light!)
Let us gather jewels for a crown above,
Send the light! (Send the light!)
Send the light! (Send the light!)
