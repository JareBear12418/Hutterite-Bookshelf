Chorus: Greater is He that is in me,
Greater is He that is in me,
Greater is He that is in me
Than he that is in the world.
1.
Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro,
Seeking whom he may devour; the bible tells me so.
Many souls have been his prey, to fall in some weak hour,
But God has promised us today His overcoming power.

2. On the day of Pentecost, a rushing mighty wind
Blew into the upper room, and baptized all of them.
With a power greater than any earthly foe,
And I'm so glad I've got it too, I'll let the whole world know.
