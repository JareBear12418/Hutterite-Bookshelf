How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever bound?
The answer my friend, is blowing in the wind;
The answer is blowing in the wind.

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one person have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer my friend, is blowing in the wind;
The answer is blowing in the wind.

How many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
How many years must some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer my friend, is blowing in the wind;
The answer is blowing in the wind.
