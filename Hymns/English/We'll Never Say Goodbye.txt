1. Our friends on earth we meet with pleasure,
While swift the moments fly,
Yet ever comes the thot of sadness
That we must say goodbye.

Chorus:
We'll never say goodbye in heav'n,
We'll never say goodbye, (goodbye)
For in that land of joy and song
We'll never say goodbye.

2. How joyful is the thot that lingers,
When loved ones cross death's sea,
That when our labors will are ended,
With them we'll ever be.

3. No parting words shall e'er be spoken
In that bright land of flowers,
But songs of joy, and peace, and gladness,
Shall evermore be ours.

We shall never say 'goodbye' in heaven
( The words of a dying Christian woman)
