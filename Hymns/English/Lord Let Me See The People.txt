1. Lord, let me see the people,
There's so many now in need.
Lord, let me take a message, let me plant a seed.
There's so many now that's hurting;
They're broken deep inside.
Oh, lead me sweet, sweet Spirit,
In your love let me abide.

Chorus
Lord, let me see the people;
Lord, let me see the people.
Lord, I'm just a steeple pointing to the sky.
Let me go where they are hurting, cry when they cry;
Lord, let me see the people;
Lord, don't let them die.

2. Lord, let me see the people,
The way that you them see.
Lord, let us be a people that will pray continually;
Lay on our hearts a burden
To reach those which are lost.
And help us serve you Jesus,
No matter what the cost.
