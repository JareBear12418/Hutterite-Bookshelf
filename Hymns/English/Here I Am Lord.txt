1. I the Lord of the sea and rain,
I have heard my people cry,
All who dwell in deepest sin,
My hand will save,
I who made the stars of night,
I will make their darkness bright,
Who will bear my light to them?
Whom shall I send?

2. Here I am Lord, Is it I Lord?
I have heard you, calling in the night,
I will go Lord, if you'll lead me,
I will hold, your people in my heart.

3. I the Lord of the wind and flame,
I will tend the poor and lame,
I will set a feast for them,
My hand will save,
Finest bread I will provide,
Till their hearts be satisfied,
I will give my life to them,
Whom shall I send?

4. I the Lord of snow and rain,
I have borne my people's blame,
I have bled for love of them, They turn away,
I will break their hearts of stone,
Give them hearts for love alone,
I will speak my word to them,
Whom shall I send?
