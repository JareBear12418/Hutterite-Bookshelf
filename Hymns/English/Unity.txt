Chorus:
Jesus, help us live in peace,
From our blindness set us free.
Fill us with Your healing love.
Help us live in Unity.

1. Many times we disagree
O'er what's right or wrong to do.
It's so hard to really see.
From the other's point of view.

2. How we long for power and fame,
Seeking every earthly thing;
We forget the One who came
As a servant not a king.
