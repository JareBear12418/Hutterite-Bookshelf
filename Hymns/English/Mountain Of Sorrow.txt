1. You turn to face the morning;
You can feel the rain before you even look outside.
Through a cloudy windowpane
You're reminded of the way you feel inside.
You cry, 'God I can't go on;
Will time never heal the wounds?
I feel I can't hold on another day:'

Chorus:
When a mountain of sorrow
Leaves a river of heartache,
In a valley of darkness, that you don't understand;
Take the high road to heaven
At the crossroad to Calvary,
To the refuge of Jesus, lay it all in his hands
And let it go.

2. You're the life in every crowd,
But inside you're an island in the sea.
Hollow empty words fill the time,
But don't always fill the need.
Jesus knows your pain,
He'll go with you all the way
There's nowhere you'll go today he hasn't been.
