1. From the dust of the earth God created man
His breath made man a living soul;
For God loved the world, He gave His only son,
And that is why I love Him so.

Chorus:
I was made in His likeness, created in His image,
For I was born to serve the Lord;
And I can't deny Him I'll always walk beside Him
For I was born to serve the Lord.

2. My hands were made to help my neighbor
My eyes were made to read God's Word;
My feet were made to walk in his footsteps
And my body is the temple of the Lord.
