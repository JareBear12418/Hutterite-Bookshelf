1. If you want to feel real happy as you travel here below
Talk to Jesus, talk to Jesus everyday;
If you need a little sunshine when your clouds are hanging low,
Talk to Jesus, talk to Jesus everyday.

Chorus:
Talk to Jesus in the morning,
Talk to Jesus noon and night,
He will guide away your sorrows,
He will make your burdens light;
He will send you forth rejoicing
As you journey on your way,
Talk to Jesus, talk to Jesus everyday.

2. If old Satan tries to tempt you and you don't know what to do,
Talk to Jesus, talk to Jesus everyday;
If you're burdened down with sorrow and you're all alone and blue,
Talk to Jesus, talk to Jesus everyday.
