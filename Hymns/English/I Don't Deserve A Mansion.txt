1. I was lost but Jesus saved me,
He gave His life on Calvary's tree;
Though I failed Him, He still loves me,
Through His grace I've been set free.

Chorus:
No, I don't deserve a mansion,
Cause I was born a sinful man;
No, I don't deserve a mansion,
But Jesus built a home for me in gloryland.

2. It was our sins that He died for,
For all mankind, He paid the price;
Who are we that He should love us,
Enough to give His life.
