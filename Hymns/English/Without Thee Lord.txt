1. Without thee, Lord, I walk an empty pathway,
Without thee, Lord, my eyes are dim with tears;
I'm as a sheepfold without a guiding shepherd,
Just as a baby without a mother dear.

Chorus: Without thee, Lord, my life would be as nothing;
Without thee, Lord, I'm as an empty sea;
I'm as a sailor without a guiding compass;
Just as a songbird without a melody.

2. Without thee, Lord, my heart is sad and lonely,
Without thee, Lord, the house of love can't dream;
I'm as a morning without refreshing dewdrops,
Just as a fountain without a flowing stream.
