1. Don't look for me to go,
Where I used to go before,
I don't go there anymore,
I found a better way;
O, don't look for me to say
Some things I used to say before,
I don't say them anymore
I found a better way.

Chorus:
O, I found a better way,
Brighter paths before my feet,
My heart rejoices sweet,
I found a better way;
And since I found a church
And I found a place to pray,
And there I found the Lord,
I found a better way.

2. Oh, don't look for me to be
Just like I used to be,
For there's been a change in me
I found a better way;
Well, I might not walk so proud,
And I might not boast so loud,
But I'm bound for heaven now
I found a better way.
