1. You lead your people out of darkness
You fed them all along the way
You gave them courage to continue
You promised them a brighter day.
Chorus:
Another mountain, another climb
Another journey but not much time
Another road to travel, another mile
Another journey Lord but not much time.

2. You sent your son to be with us
He came and walked across the land
He talked a lot about His Father
And how you hold us in your hand.

3. You raised your son to the living
You made Him Lord over all
He promised us that we should rise with Him
But only if we heard His call.

4. He promised He would send His spirit
The one who opens hearts of stone
He is here and we believe in Him
No need for us to be alone.
