Chorus: The danger the tempest forever is o'er
( The tempest is o'er )
My anchor is holding I'm saved evermore
(I'm saved evermore)
What gladness what rapture is mine;
The waters are peaceful the danger is past
(The danger is past)
My spirit is happy, I'm anchored at last,
(I'm anchored at last)
I'm anchored in love divine.

1. I found a sweet haven of sunshine at last,
With Jesus abiding above;
His dear arms around me are lovingly cast
And sweetly He tells His love.

2. He saw me in danger and lovingly came
To pilot my storm beaten soul;
Sweet peace He hath spoken, Oh bless His dear name
The billows no longer roll.
