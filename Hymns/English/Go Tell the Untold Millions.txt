1. Out in the darkness of sin they are waiting,
Lost and away from the fold;
Who'll bear the message of Christ and redemption?
See! They have never been told. (Been told)
Chorus
Go tell the untold millions
Over the whole world wide; (far and wide)
Go tell the untold millions
Tell of the Crucified.

2. Go in the power the Lord will provide you,
Led by the Spirit each day;
You cannot fail on the mission He sends you
Go then, no longer delay. (Delay)

3. Moved and constrained by the love of the Savior,
Leave friends and comforts behind;
Yield all your talents and time to His service
Go now, the lost ones to find. (To find)
