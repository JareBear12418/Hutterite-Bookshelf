1. In the harvest field now ripened,
There's a work for all to do;
Hark! The voice of God is calling,
To the harvest, calling you.

2. Does the place you're called to labor
Seem so small and little known?
It is great if God is in it,
And he'll not forget his own.

Chorus:
Little is much when God is in it,
Labor not for wealth or fame.
There's a crown, and you can win it
If you'll go in Jesus' name.

3. Are you laid aside from service,
Body worn from toil and care?
You can still be in the battle,
In the sacred place of pray'r.

4. When the conflict here is ended,
And our race on earth is run;
He will say, if we are faithful,
'Welcome home, my child; well done.'
