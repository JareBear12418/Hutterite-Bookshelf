1. He is a fountain for a thirsty soul
He is a healer and so much more
When my heart is broken by the world's demand
The pieces are mended with one scarred hand.

Chorus: And when I can't stand I have to lean
And when I can't see I must believe
The great physician's touch is a balm that can
Mend a broken heart with one scarred hand.

2. It's a hand that hung this old world in place
Oh the hand that was scarred just to give me grace
And to think a hand that holds the scars
Is small enough to mend one broken heart.
