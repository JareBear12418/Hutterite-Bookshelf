1. He let me try my wings
Because I asked Him to,
Knowing all the time I couldn't fly.
He gave my feet their liberty
And let them walk away,
And all the time I never asked Him why.

Chorus: But now I'm beginning to understand,
He bought my life and He already had it planned.
Oh foolishly, I could not see,
Sin had my vision dimmed;
He let me go just so I would know,
That I couldn't make it without Him

2. He let me choose my footsteps
Down the road of life;
And farther from His care
My feet had trod;
The easy way looked bright and gay,
Without a cross to bear,
But my road took me far away from God.
