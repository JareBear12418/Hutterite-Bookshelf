Chorus:
God will make a way, where there seems to be no way.
He works in ways we cannot see;
He will make a way for me.
He will be my guide, hold me closely to his side,
With love and strength for each new day.
He will make a way; he will make a way.

1. By a roadway in the wilderness he'll lead me,
Rivers in the desert will I see.
Heaven and earth will fade,
But his Word will still remain;
And he will do something new today.
