When burdens come so hard to bear
That no earthly friend can share
Tears drive away the smiles and leaves my heart in pain.
Then my lord from heaven above
Speaks to me in tones of love
Wipes the tears away and makes me smile again.

Chorus
I need no mansion here below
For Jesus said that i could go
To a home beyond the clouds not mad e with hands.
Oh won't you come and go along
We will sing the sweetest song
Ever played upon the harps in gloryland.

Oh the thought to me is sweet that my loved ones i shall meet.
At the ending of the journey here below
Seems i hear their voices blend
In a world without an end
I won't worry when he time shall come to go.

When Jesus comes to claim his own
I will move to my new home
I'll walk and talk with him upon the streets of gold.
A mansion is waiting me soon it's beauty i will see
In that city where we never shall grow old.
