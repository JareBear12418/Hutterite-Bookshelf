The judge was there, the jury too, and the people from a far.
A very young lad of tender youth was prisoner at the bar.
Oh, the great courtroom was crowded with an eager anxious throng.
And many a heart was aching for the boy accused of wrong.

A maiden fair with golden hair sped swiftly through the crowd.
The people gazed in wonder but spoke not one word out loud.
Then turning to the judges stand, one moment did she pause.
And smiling through her tears she said, judge let me plead the cause.

Then turning to the jury box to make her simple plea.
This prisoner is innocent; I know you'll set him free.
Remember you were once a boy, just like this fair young lad.
If you could make him off discharge, you'll drive him to the best.

Next Sunday is our wedding day, the dreams of wondrous life.
When at the alter he will make me his sweet loving wife.
Unless you aim to blind our lives, don't say that we must part.
And don't forget your loving wife was once your dear sweetheart.

The jury did not leave the room, for they had quickly agreed.
The foreman briefly signed a note and gave the clerk to read.
Not guilty were the only words the maiden heard them say.
Her lover clasped her in his arms. Love always has its ways.
