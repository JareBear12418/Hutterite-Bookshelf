1. Trav'ling through this foreign land,
Dust and shadows seem to blind us,
Lightning flashes, thunder rolls,
Frightening gales around us blow.
When our cares of life are over, and the crown of life is won,
Up in heaven we'll be singing,
with the host the endless song! (endless song)

Chorus: Hallelujah to the Lamb! (Hallelujah to the Lamb)
Hallelujah to His name! (Hallelujah to His name)
We will shout and we will sing! (We will shout and we will sing)
To our dear beloved King! (To our dear beloved King)
Singing glory to His name, (Singing glory to His name)
To our mighty great I Am. (To our mighty great I Am)

2. When the dark of night has gone,
And we'll view eternal dawning,
God Himself will take us home,
Where no teardrops will be known.
Journey onward, ever onward;
take up courage, friend be strong,
Up in heaven we'll be singing,
with the host the endless song!
