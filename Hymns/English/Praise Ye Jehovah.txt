1. Praise ye Jehovah! praise the Lord most holy,
Who cheers the contrite, girds with strength the weak;
Praise Him who will with glory crown the lowly,
And with salvation beautify the meek.

2. Praise ye Jehovah! for His loving kindness,
And all the tender mercy He hath shown;
Praise Him who pardons all our sin and blindness,
And calls us sons, and takes us for His own.

3. Praise ye Jehovah! source of all our blessing;
Before His gifts earth's richest boons wax dim;
Resting in Him, His peace and joy possession,
All things are ours, for we have all in Him.

4. Praise ye the Father, God the Lord! who gave us,
With full and perfect love, His only Son;
Praise ye the Son! who died Himself to save us;
Praise ye the Spirit! praise the Three in One!
