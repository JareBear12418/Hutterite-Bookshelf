1. 'I am the man' Jonah said, while the boat was reelin' and a rockin'
'I am the man, I've been running from the Lord'
'I am the man,' Jonah said, while the boat was reelin' and a rockin'
'Pick me up, throw me out, I am the man.'

Chorus:
Running, running, running, 'I've been running from the Lord'
'So pick me up, I'm to blame, throw me overboard,
Well the winds will cease, and the waves will stop,
This old boat won't reel and rock,
Pick me up, throw me out, I am the man.'

2. Well if the Lord shall ever lay his mighty hand on you,
Don't try to run away and hide like Jonah tried to do;
For troubles sure to overtake you if you disobey
Don't be like old Jonah, when he had to say.
