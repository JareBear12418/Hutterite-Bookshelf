1. Oh, God is love, He it is who frees me,
For God is love and He loves us all.

Chorus:
Therefore I say again that God is love,
For our God is love and He loves us all.

2. I lay in bondage of death and evil,
In bonds I lay and was Satan's thrall.

3. He sent us Jesus, the faithful Savior,
He sent us Jesus to make us whole.

4. He sent His call to me through His mercy,
By His own Spirit He sent His call.

5. O love, thou healest my deepest sorrow,
For only thou canst my grief console.

6. Thou bringest joy to my heavy heart,
With Thy peace Thou fillest my weary soul.

7. Our heritage shall be joy forever;
God's loving heart shall be all our goal.
