1. To Christ be loyal and be true;
His banner be unfurled,
And bourne aloft till is secured
The conquest of the world.

Chorus:
To Christ the Lord be true;
For He will go with you,
And help you all your conflicts through;
To Christ the Lord be true.

2. To Christ be loyal and be true;
He needs brave volunteers
To stand against the powers of sin,
Moved not by frowns or fears.

3. To Christ be loyal and be true;
In noble service prove
Your faith and your fidelity,
The fervor of your love.
