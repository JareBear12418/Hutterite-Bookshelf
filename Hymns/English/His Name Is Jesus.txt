1. I have made a lot of friends in my lifetime,
And I've come to appreciate them all;
But I've found one friend who is closer than a brother;
He's my best friend, and He's the precious Son of God.

Chorus: His name is Jesus; His name is Jesus!
What a privilege to know the Son of God!
He lives inside of me and He walks beside me,
He's my best friend, and He's the precious Son of God.

2. There's a lot of folks I like to spend some time with,
Just to be around and get to know a little more;
But I've got one friend that I find the most refreshing,
It's spending time with Jesus Christ, my Lord.
