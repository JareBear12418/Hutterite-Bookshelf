1. Behold how good and how pleasant it is,
For brethren to dwell together in unity to live;
Sharing with one another, the good things of the Lord,
It's our reasonable service for the Lord.

Chorus:
It's that living water
That makes me happy when my brother smiles,
It's that bread from heaven,
That makes me want to share my life.

2. Thru our many trials, we must understand,
Division and contention are the adversary's plan;
But through the power of Jesus, on hind's feet we can stand,
On the high places with the Son of man.

3. From the treasury of the Word, it's seldom heard today.
How to live all things common our old man put away,
But I feel I must tell you, It's not too much to afford
For the Kingdom of Heaven is our reward.
