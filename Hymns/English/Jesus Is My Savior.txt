1. Someone's watching over me,
Someone who's very special,
Someone's guiding me, I can feel His unseen hand;
Everyday I look for Him, everyday He's there,
He used to be a stranger, now He is a friend who cares.

Chorus:
Jesus, is my Savior
Jesus, is my friend,
Jesus, no more a stranger,
He died for me and He is my best friend.

2. Someone's reaching out for you,
Someone who loves you dearly,
Jesus is a friend, who'll care and understand;
Jesus died upon the cross, to save your soul from sin,
And He will be your Savior, if you'll ask Him to come in.
