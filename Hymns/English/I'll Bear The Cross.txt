1. Upon a lonely mountain far away,
A symbol for the world to see.
My Savior took my place and bore my sins that day,
To manifest his love for me.

Chorus:
I'll bear the cross until I get to Calvary,
My soul in glory there abides.
I'll wear the banner that the Lord has made for me,
To show the world I'll bear his love with pride.

2. His life was given there to set me free,
From all the sorrow sin will bring.
My Savior guides my feet and cheers my heart,
He makes a way for everything.
