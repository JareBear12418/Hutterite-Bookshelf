1. I need the prayers of those I love,
While trav'ling o'er life's rugged way;
That I may true and faithful be,
And live for Jesus everyday.

Chorus:
I want my friends to pray for me,
To bear my tempted soul above;
And intercede with God for me,
I need the prayers of those I love.

2. I need the prayers of those I love,
To help me in each trying hour;
To bear my tempted soul to Him,
That He may keep me by His pow'r.

3. I want my friends to pray for me,
To hold me up on wings of faith;
That I may walk the narrow way,
Kept by our Fathers glorious grace.
