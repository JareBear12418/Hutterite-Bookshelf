If life is like a candle bright,
Death must be the wind.
You can close your window tight
And it still comes blowing in.

So I will climb the highest hill,
And watch the rising sun.
And I pray that I don't feel the chill,
Till I'm too old to die young.

CH:  Let me watch my children grow
To see what they become.
0h, Lord, don't let that cold wind blow,
Till I'm too old to die young.

Now I have had some dear sweet friends
I thought would never die.
Now the only thing that's left of them,
Is the teardrops in my eyes.

If I could have one wish today
And know it would be done,
Well, I would say everyone could stay
Till they're too old to die young.
