1. Happiness is to know the Savior,
Living a life within His favor,
Having a change in my behavior
Happiness is the Lord;

Chorus:
Real joy is mine,
No matter if teardrops start;
I've found the secret
It's Jesus in my heart!

2. Happiness is a new creation
'Jesus and me' in close relation,
Having a part in His salvation
Happiness is the Lord;

3. Happiness is to be forgiven,
Living a life that's worth the livin',
Taking a trip that leads to heaven
Happiness is the Lord;
