1. Ever since time begin, It's been part of His plan
To lend us a hand when we are in need
If we'll only ask He will help with the task
Our troubles won't last If we only believe,

Chorus: I believe,
He knows what I'm saying
He hears when I'm praying
Lord help me please
He meets all my needs
From the great to the smallest
And man stands the tallest,
When he's down on his knees

2. When troubles set in, time and again
Pains just won't end and our heartaches won't ease
Life is hard on us all and like one we're bound to fall
We can only stand tall when we're down on our knees.
