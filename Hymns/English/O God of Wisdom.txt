1. O God of wisdom, life and love,
Thine is the blessed plan
In holy bonds of love to join
The twain, created man.

2. These souls betrothed before Thee stand;
Thy blessing we implore;
Unite Thou them in heart and hand,
And guide them evermore.

3. As they go forth upon life's way,
Sustain them by Thy grace;
May they Thy holy laws obey
And live in joy and peace.

4. May they with holy lives adorn
Thy doctrines, Lord, and be
Amid life's sunshine and its storm
True witnesses for Thee.

5. And when Thou, Lord, shalt come again
To gather home Thine own,
May they, with duty nobly done,
Be blessed before Thy throne.
