1. There is a song in my heart today,
Something I never had;
Jesus has taken my sins away
O say, but I'm glad!

Chorus:
O say, but I'm glad, I'm glad,
O say, but I'm glad;
Jesus has come and my cup's overrun
O say, but I'm glad.

2. Wonderful, marvelous love He brings
Into a heart that's sad;
Thru darkest tunnels the soul just sings,
'O say, but I'm glad!'

3. Won't you come to Him with all your care,
Weary and worn and sad?
You too will sing as His love you share,
'O say, but I'm glad!'
