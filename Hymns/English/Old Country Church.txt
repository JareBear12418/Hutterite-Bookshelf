1. There's a place dear to me, where I'm longing to be,
With my friends at the old country church;
There with mother we went and our Sundays we spent,
With my friends at the old country church.

Chorus:
O Precious years (Precious years) of memory, (of memory)
O what joy (O what joy) they bring to me; (they bring to me)
How I'd long (How I long) once more to be, (once more to be)
With my friends at the old country church.

2. As a small country boy, how my heart beat with joy,
As I knelt in the old country church;
And our Savior above by His wonderful love,
Saved my soul at the old country church.

3. How I wish that today, All the people would pray.
As we prayed in the old country church;
If they'd only confess, Jesus surely would bless,
As he did in that old country church.

4. My thoughts make me weak, for so many now sleep,
In their graves near the old country church;
And someday I may rest, with my friends I loved best,
In a grave near the old country church.
