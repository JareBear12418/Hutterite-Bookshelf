Jesus was His name and love was His game.
And every word He spoke was the truth.
Guess who paid the cost when they nailed Him to the cross.
And He paid the price for me and for you.

CH:Yes, He walked (yes, He walked) up the hill of Calvary.
God was giving up His only Child
And it's there (yes, it's there) in the book for us to read,
How He walked that impossible mile.

O the thunder it did roll and the wind it did blow
As they walked through the streets single file
And the blood began to flow from the crown of thorns He wore.
As He walked that impossible mile.
