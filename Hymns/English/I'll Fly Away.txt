1. Some glad morning when this life is over,
I'll (fly away,) fly away; (fly away)
To a home on God's celestial shore,
I'll (fly away) fly away. (fly away.)

Chorus:
I'll (fly away) fly away, O glory,
I'll (fly away,) fly away; (in the morning,)
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
I'll (fly away,) fly away. (fly away.)

2. When the shadows of this life have grown,
I'll (fly away,) fly away; (fly away)
Like a bird from prison bars has flown,
I'll (fly away,) fly away; (fly away;)

3. Just a few more weary days and then,
I'll (fly away,) fly away; (fly away)
To a land where joys shall never end,
I'll (fly away) fly away; (fly away)
