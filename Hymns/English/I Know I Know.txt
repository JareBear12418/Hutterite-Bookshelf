1. I know that my Redeemers liveth,
(And on the earth) (again shall stand);
I know eternal life He's giveth,
(That grace and power) are in His hand.

2. I know, I know that Jesus liveth
(And on the earth) again shall stand;
(I know, I know) that life He giveth,
(That grace and power) are in His hand.

3. I know His promise never faileth,
(The word He speaks) it cannot die;
Though cruel death my flesh assaileth
(Yet I shall see) Him by end by.

4. I know my mansion He prepareth
(That where He is) there I may be;
Oh wonderous thought for me He careth
(And He at last) will come for me.
