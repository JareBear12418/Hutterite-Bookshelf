1. Soon we'll come to the end life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore;
Till we gather in heavens bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore.

Chorus:
If we never meet again, this side of heaven,
(never again this side of heaven)
As we struggle thru this world and its strife
(strug - - gle thru this world and its strife)
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven;
(meeting place somewhere in heaven;)
By the side of the river of life.
(By the shining river of life.)
Where the charming roses bloom forever
(roses bloom ever and ever)
And where separations come never more,
(Separations come no more,)
If we never meet this side of heaven,
(never meet this side of heaven)
I will meet you on that beautiful shore.

2. O so often we're parted with sorrow
Benedictions often quicken our pain,
But we never shall have sorrow in heaven
God be with you till we meet again.

3. O they say we shall meet by the river
Where no storm clouds ever darken the sky,
And they say we'll be happy in heaven
In the wonderful sweet by and by.
