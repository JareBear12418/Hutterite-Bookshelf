1. There's a little white church in the valley
That stands in my memories days;
And it seems I can hear the bells ringing,
Though I am many miles away.
And many times on Sunday morning
The whole country side would gather there,
They would all kneel down by the altar
As they lifted their voice in prayer.

Chorus:
O that church in the valley
O that little white church,
Is a place I love so well,
Now I'm sad and I'm lonely
Yes, I'm sad and I'm lonely
For the little white church in the dale.

2. They would sing the old song, Rock of Ages,
O Christ let me hide myself in Thee,
And I know some of them are waiting
Just over the dark stormy sea;
I know their troubles have all ended
How happy forever they will be,
They are waiting and watching up yonder,
For the coming home of you and me.
