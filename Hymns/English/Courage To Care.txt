1. Just to know someone cares, gives me courage to go on,
What a balm for my lonely heart.
Someone knows all about me, understands every part;
Just to know fills my heart with a song.

Chorus: It takes courage to care when the going gets rough;
It takes courage to share when there's barely enough.
Courage cares like the widow, who gave all she had;
Courage cares like Jesus, making others glad.

2. Jesus faced all our sins with the courage to go on,
In the garden alone He prayed.
Oh, what love, what compassion, when God's will He obeyed;
Just to know fills my heart with a song.

3. Going forth with the truth and the courage to be strong,
With the joy of the Lord within.
Trust, obey, all for Jesus, with such courage you'll win;
Just to know fills my heart with a song.
