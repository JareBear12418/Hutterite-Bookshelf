1. Many times in my life there are disappointments;
Many things to break my heart along the way.
But through your grace I find great consolation;
For each valley only taught me how to pray.

Chorus: Lord, let me live my life for you this side of heaven,
May you be the only star to light my way.
So that I may win some souls for you, Jesus,
Help to find the little lamb that's gone astray,
Lord, let your Spirit lead and guide me every day.

2. As I work in this life for you, Jesus;
Help my faith to grow stronger every day.
And let me hear you say, 'My child you have made it,
With some souls that you have won along the way'.
