1. I can't see your heart - I can't read your mind
There's no way for me to know - The feelings that you hide
For me to see your love, You've got to let it show
Love isn't love, till you let it go

2. Tell me what's the use - Just holding on
Someday you'll find - What you thought you had is gone
You can't save your love like in silver and gold
Love isn't love, till you let it go

Chorus: Love isn't love till you give it away
Like a never ending circle
It comes back your way
Love in your heart wasn't put there to stay
Love isn't love till you give it away

3. Just look at the cross - If you're ever in doubt
You'll see the blood - He has for you poured out
A love so great - No tomb could ever hold
Love isn't love, till you let it go.
