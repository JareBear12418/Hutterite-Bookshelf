1. Be like a city that's set on a hill,
Let your light shine unto those who are still
Groping in the darkness, searching for the light.
Be ye a beacon in this dark, dark night.
Chorus
Be ye a beacon, like you're called to be,
Upon a hillside that all the world may see.
Do not try to hide your candle somewhere out of sight,
But let it be a beacon in this dark, dark night.

2. There is only one thing that can make us shine,
Jesus must be reigning in your heart and mine.
Yes, He is the only light the world can ever see.
So, let Him live within you, and a beacon be.

3. Oh, Jesus said to all of us, 'Be not ashamed
To be my disciples and to bear my name;
If you are ashamed of me, one thing I must say,
I will be ashamed of you on Judgment Day.'
