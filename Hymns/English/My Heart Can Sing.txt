1. My heart can sing, when I pause to remember,
A heartache here is but a stepping stone,
Along the trail that's winding always upwards,
This troubled world is not my final home.

Chorus:
But until then, my heart will go on singing,
Until then with joy I'll carry on;
Until the day my eyes behold a city,
Until the day God calls me home.

2. The things of earth will dim and lose there value,
When we recall they're borrowed for awhile;
And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,
Remember they will only bring a smile.

3. This weary world with all it's toils and struggles,
May take it's toll of misery and strife;
The soul of men is like a waiting falcon
When it's released it's destined for the sky
