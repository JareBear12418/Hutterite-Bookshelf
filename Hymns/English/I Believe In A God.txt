1. I believe in a God, even though I can't see Him
Even when He is silent, I know He is there
I know if I wait, on the Lord and will listen
In a still small voice, He speaks to me here.

Chorus: I believe in a God, and I know that I shall see Him
Someday in Heaven upon His great throne
I believe in a God, and I know He is with me
Will be with me here, 'til I enter my home.

2. I believe that the sun, even when I can't see it
Is there when the clouds, keep it hidden from view
I know it will shine, once again in its splendor
When the clouds break away, and let it shine through.

3. I believe in a love, that is true and tender
For God in His love, sent it down from above
I believe in a love, even when I can't feel it
In this cold empty world, where few know His love.
