1. Two little orphans, a boy and a girl,
Were standing by the church door;
The little girl's feet were as brown as her curls,
That hung on the dress that she wore.

Chorus:
Mama's in heaven, they took her away,
Left Jim and me home all alone;
We came here to sleep at the close of the day,
For we have no mama nor home.

2. The little boy's clothes were all ragged and torn,
And tears shone in his blue eyes:
'Why don't you go home to your mommy,' I said,
And that was the maiden's reply.

3. 'We can't earn our bread we're too little,' she said,
'Jim's five, and I'm only seven;
We can't earn our living since papa is dead,
And our darling, mama in heaven.'

Chorus:
Mama's in heaven, they took her away,
Left Jimmy and me all along;
She called for her darling, she told me one day,
And perhaps she'll take them tonight.

4. Papa was drowned in the sea long ago,
We waited all night on the shore;
For he was a life saving captain you know,
He never came back anymore.

5. The sexton came early to ring the church bell,
He found them beneath the snow white;
The angels made room for two orphans to dwell,
In heaven with mama that night.
