1. Life is just a passing moment
On a never ending trail
Though my pathway wanders for a while
Someday my ship will sail.

Chorus
But I will walk this road a while
I will walk it with a smile - I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied

2. There's eternity before me
Just beyond the darkening veil
Oh my spirit's longing to go on
Someday my ship will sail.
