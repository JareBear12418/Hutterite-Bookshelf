1. Tender love of Jesus, so lovely and so pure;
Flowing thru this vessel, to strengthen, fill and cure
All the doubt and turmoil that's caused by sin and shame;
Making me a witness to His most holy name.

Chorus:
Yes, love, (The holy presence,)
Christ's love, (the living flame,)
Pure love, (The Spirit's witness)
great love; (that lauds His name;)
With joy my heart is singing,
The things of life grow dim,
For Christ (My dear Redeemer,)
Is love! (I am in Him.)

2. Thru the passing ages flowed down this love divine,
Lighting men and angels, and causing them to shine,
With a heav'nly radiance,
His glory from above,
Sunshine of the Spirit, the holy light of love.
