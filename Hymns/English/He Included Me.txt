1. When Jesus said, 'If you believe,
In me, you shall be saved,'
He included me, He included me,
And when He said, 'Fear not,
For I go with you all the way,'
He included me, thank the Lord.

Chorus:
He included me, He included me,
When he died to pay the price,
For sins upon the cross;
He included me, He included me,
He included me, thank the Lord.

2. When Jesus said, 'He came to seek
And save those which were lost,'
He included me, He included me,
And when He said, 'Forgive them
As He died upon the cross,'
He included me, thank the Lord.
