1. I remember Daddy's hands folded silently in prayer
Reaching out to hold me when I had a nightmare
You could read quite a story in the calluses and lines
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind.

2. I remember Daddy's hands how they held my Momma tight
And patted my back for something done right
There things that I've forgotten that I loved about the man
But I'll always remember the love in Daddy's hands.

Chorus:
Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was crying
Daddy's hands were hard as steel when I'd done wrong
Daddy's hands weren't always gentle
but I've come to understand
There was always love in Daddy's hands.

3. I remember Daddy's hands how they held his bible near
Reading to the family these times were so dear
With tears in his eyes he would ask us all to kneel
Things in life will change but memories never will.

4. I remember Daddy's hands working till they bled
Sacrificed unselfishly just to keep us all fed
But if I could do things over I'd live my life again
And never take for granted the love in Daddy's hands.
