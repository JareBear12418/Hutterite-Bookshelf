1. I often think of the days so swiftly passing away
The road to heaven seems hard to find
But I am doing my best to reach the home of the blest
And make it easier for those behind.

Chorus: Oh, Yes, I'm working the road (to glory,)
Working the road (to glory)
Helping the weak and blind
I want to smooth out the road
That leads to heaven above
And make it easier for those behind.

2. The road to heaven is straight and, oh, so narrow the gate
Around the trials on every side
So we must clean out the chaff that hinders many a prayers
And make it easier for those behind.

3. I'm trying daily to live for others, something to give
My brother grasping in darkness blind
I want to hear them someday in glory, lovingly say
You've made it easier for those behind.
