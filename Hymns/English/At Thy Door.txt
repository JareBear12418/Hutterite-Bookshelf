1. See the Savior meekly standing
At thy threshhold night and day;
Hear Him gently rapping, rapping,
Hear His pleading, hear Him say: '
At thy doorway I am knocking
For admittance full and free;
If thou hear My voice, and open,
I'll come in, and sup with Thee.'

Chorus:
Knocking, ever knocking,
(Knocking, ever knocking, knocking, knocking, ever knocking,)
Waiting at thy open door;
(Waiting at thy open door; knocking, ever knocking,)
Open, quickly open,
(Open quickly, open, open, open, quickly open.)
Lest the Savior knock no more.

2. Hear the Savior gently calling
To the souls with sin oppressed:
'Come to Me ye heavyladen,
Come and I will give you rest.
Take My easy yoke upon you,
Bear My burden, learn of Me;
And to you I'll give refreshing
Strength and pow'r, and victory.'

3. Hear the blessed Savior saying,
'Son, repent, give Me thine heart!
Turn thee, turn thee from thy straying,
From the paths of sin depart!
And to thee I'll be a faithful
Friend, and Comforter, and Guide;
I'll go with thee thru the valley,
To thy home beyond the tide.'
