1. They all sat down to share, in a little room upstairs;
The feast of the unleavened bread;
Verily I say, one of you will betray
And the friends of Jesus answered Him saying.

Chorus:
Lord, is it I? They all began to cry.
Lord, is it I, is it I?
Will one of us betray, kiss and run away?
Lord, is it I, is it I?

2. This bread is my body, this cup is my blood.
This do in remembrance of me;
But after I go, before the cock crows,
Someone will deny knowing me.

3. Lord, is it I? They all began to cry,
Lord, is it I, is it I?
Will one be ashamed, to mention your sweet name?
Lord, is it I, is it I?
