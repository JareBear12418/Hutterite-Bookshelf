1. There's a dear and precious book, tho it's worn and faded now,
Which recalls those happy days of long ago,
When I stood at mother's knee with her hand upon my brow,
And I heard her voice in gentle tones and low.

Chorus:
Blessed book, (Blessed book,) precious book, (precious book,)
On thy dear old tearstained leaves I love to look; (I love to look)
Thou art sweeter day by day as I walk the narrow way
That leads at last to that bright home above.

2. As she read the stories o'er of those mighty men of old,
And of Joseph and of Daniel and their tri'ls;
Of that little David bold who became a king at last
And of Satan and his many wicked wiles.

3. Then she read of Jesus' love as He blest the children dear,
How He suffered, bled and died upon the tree;
Of His heavy load of care, then she dried my flowing tears
With her kisses as she said it was for me.

4. Well, those days are past and gone but their mem'ry lingers still
And the dear old book each day has been my guide;
And I seek to do His will, as my mother taught me then
And ever in my heart His word abides.
