1. Christ is coming, quickly coming
In a cloud of flaming fire;
Some will rise in wondrous brightness,
Others sink beneath His ire.
O the glorious day of triumph
For the soul that's robed in white!
Saints will rise with shouts of vict'ry,
Sinners sink to endless night.

Chorus:
Christ is coming
(Christ is coming in His glory,)
yes, He's coming:
(yes, He's coming by and by;)
Every eye shall see Him then;
(Every eye shall see Him coming, every eye shall see Him then:)
O how sweet will be the meeting
(O how sweet will be the meeting, and how fond will be the greeting,)
Where we'll never part again!
(Where we'll never, never part, no, never part again!)

2. Yes, we know that Christ is coming,
Soon we'll hear the trumpet sound;
We can meet Him, hallelujah,
If in righteousness we're found!
Some will cry for rocks and mountains
To conceal them from His face;
Those who now reject His mercy
And will not accept His grace.

3. Christ is coming, quickly coming,
Hear the warning, ye that sleep;
O prepare your souls to meet Him,
Or in anguish you shall weep!
If He comes and you're not ready
You no more shall see His face;
If you now reject His mercy
You'll be lost without His grace.

4. Christ is coming, hallelujah!
Shout His praises, all ye saints!
For we know His smiles will greet us
As we enter through the gates.
We are ready, clad in whiteness,
All our sins are washed away;
With our blessed loving Savior
We'll abide in endless day.
