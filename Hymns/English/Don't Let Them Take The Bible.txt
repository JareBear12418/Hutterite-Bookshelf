1. They are trying to take the Bible out of our schoolroom,
They say our children can't give thanks with prayer,
But if they take the Bible out of the schoolroom,
Then how can this world get anywhere?

Chorus:
Don't let them take the Bible out of our schoolroom,
Don't let them close the door of your child's heart,
Don't let them rob the children of Salvation,
If you do we're going to lose them from the start.

2. Our leaders had a meeting in the Capital,
They write the laws that keep our country free,
But if they cease to teach our children about Jesus,
No schoolroom will teach them what they need.

3. If it's right to allow liquor in most countries.
O the newsstands of the sinful pictures there;
If it's right for movie pictures of corruption,
Dear God, how can they say it's wrong for prayer.
