1. In a world that's filled with so much suffering,
Sometimes we wonder why these things must be,
A loved one with such pain beyond our understanding,
Makes me long for that land where there will be:

Chorus:
No young ones crying, no loved ones dying,
In a land free from all disease.
On the hills of glory, I will tell my story,
Of how Jesus, saved a wretch like me.

I will go to a place prepared for me.
Where death's a stranger, and there will be no pain or fear,
I'll inherit a home called Heaven where I'll see:
