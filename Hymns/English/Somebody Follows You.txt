1. Brother, along on the highway of life,
Strive to be good and true;
Take Jesus with you to aid in the strife,
Somebody follows you.

Chorus:
Somebody follows you, (follows you)
Watching the things you do, (you do)
Walk in the light and be pure in His sight,
Somebody follows you.

2. Little you think when you turn from the right,
Who sees the things you do;
But others watch you by day and by night,
Somebody follows you.

3. Never forget that the Lord keeps His own,
So to His Word be true;
Many are longing the way to be shown,
O let them follow you.
