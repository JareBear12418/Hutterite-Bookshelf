1. Dear brother, mama left us this morning,
Death's angels took her away;
She's gone to meet daddy, up there in heaven,
But we'll meet her again someday.

Chorus:
She left this world with a smile on her face,
Whispering the Savior's name;
Dear brother, mama left us this morning,
To a city where there is no pain.

2. As I stood by her bedside, those last few moments,
I lived my childhood again;
I thought of you brother and of the old homestead,
And my tears they fell like rain.
