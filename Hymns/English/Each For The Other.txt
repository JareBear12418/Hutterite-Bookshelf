1. Darling, the day has come, that we've been dreaming of,
When at the altar white, we'll say our vows of love;
Oh, what a happy time, all gone each doubt and fear,
And with these promises, I'll add this one, my dear.

Chorus:
Each for the other and both for the Lord,
Oh, happy memories let the angels record;
Vows sweetly spoken, may they never be broken,
Each for the other and both for the Lord.

2. We'll walk together love, through sunshine, through the shade,
We'll share our tears and smiles and travel unafraid;
Halos of happiness will crown each passing day,
Till heaven shines ahead and beckons us away.
