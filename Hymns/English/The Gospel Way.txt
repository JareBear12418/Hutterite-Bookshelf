1. There's a right and a wrong way to praise the Lord.
And the right way you must take
If you want a friend at the journey's end
Out of dept on that great payday,

Chorus:
Never stop or wait lest you be too late
To inherit the golden crown
You must walk each day in the gospel way
If the works of God be found.

2. Do you love your neighbor as yourself?
Do you cheat him not in trade?
Would your conscience groan on tomorrow's dawn?
Should you meet him on the way?

3. Never do good deeds for the praise of man
Giving gold that man might see
But in secret give and in secret pray
He'll reward you openly.
