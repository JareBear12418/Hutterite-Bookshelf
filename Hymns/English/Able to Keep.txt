1. Jesus, my Lord, my life, my all,
In Thee I trust, in Thee I hide;
I know Thou wilt not let me fall
If I stay by Thy side.

Refrain:
In Thy dear hands of love I lay,
Fulfill Thy purposes in me;
Teach me to say from day to day,
Thy will be done in me.

2. The storms of life are fierce and dark,
And hosts of Satan press me hard;
But still Thy strength can keep my bark,
Though broken and sin-marred.

3. Though hard the cross, the burden great,
And I so weak, so poor, undone;
Yet on Thy side I'll stand and wait,
Till victory is won.

4. The battle, Lord, is Thine, and we,
Though foe may kill us; yet I see
Thy blood sets poor dead captives free,
Though fierce the war may be.
