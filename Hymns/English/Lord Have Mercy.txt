1. Jesus, I've forgotten the words that you have spoken,
Promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim.
With a doubting heart, I follow the paths of earthly wisdom;
Forgive me for my unbelief, renew the fire again.

Chorus:
Lord, have mercy,
Christ, have mercy,
Lord, have mercy, on me.
(repeat)

2. I have built an altar where I worship things of man,
I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from you;
Now I am returning to your mercies ever flowing;
Pardon my transgressions, help me love you again.

3. I have longed to know you, and all your tender mercies,
Like a river of forgiveness ever flowing without end.
So I bow my heart before you in the goodness of your presence,
Your grace forever shining like a beacon in the night.
