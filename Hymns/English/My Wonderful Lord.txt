1. I have found a deep peace that I never had known
And a joy this world could not afford,
Since I yielded control!
Of my body and soul
To my wonderful, wonderful Lord.

Chorus:
My wonderful Lord, my wonderful Lord,
By angels and seraphs in heaven adored;
I bow at Thy shrine, My Savior Divine,
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

2. I desire that my life shall be ordered by Thee,
That my will be in perfect accord
With Thine own sovereign will
Thy desires to fulfill,
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

3. All the talents I have, I have laid at Thy feet,
Thy approval shall be my reward;
Be my store great or small,
I surrender it all
To my wonderful, wonderful Lord

4. Thou art fairer to me than the fairest of earth,
Thou omnipotent, life giving Word;
O Thou Ancient of Days,
Thou art worthy all praise,
My wonderful, wonderful Lord!
