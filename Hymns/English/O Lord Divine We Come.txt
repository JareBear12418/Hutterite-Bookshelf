1. O Lord divine, we come to pray,
This bridal pair to bless,
Lead Thou them on in holy ways
And paths of righteousness.

2. Grant knowledge, wisdom, light and love,
That Spirit filled they be;
A light and pattern ever true,
Extolling only Thee!

3. Therefore again we pray, dear Lord,
Bless Thou their journey here;
Unite their hearts and hands as one,
In Christian love sincere.

4. When this short span of life is o'er,
Their race on earth is run;
Forever may Thee Lord adore
With that celestial throng.
