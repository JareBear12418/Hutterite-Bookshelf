1. He my Shepherd is
Who dearly loves His sheep;
He holds them in His arms
Saying, 'Let them come to me.'

2. He my Brother is
The lamb upon the hill;
Who learned my ways of weakness,
To do our Father's will.

3. He has made the sun
The sea waves and the land;
And He will hold His sheep
Ever gently in His hand.

4. The Lord my Shepherd is
He dearly loves His sheep;
He holds them in His loving arms,
Saying, 'Let them come to me.'
