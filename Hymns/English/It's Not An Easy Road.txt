1. It's not an easy road we are trav'ling to heaven,
For many are the thorns on the way;
It's not an easy road but the Savior is with us,
His presence gives us joy every day.

Chorus: No, no, it's not an easy road,
No, no, it's not an easy road;
But Jesus walks with me and brightens the journey,
And lightens ev'ry heavy load.

2. It's not an easy road, there are trials and troubles,
And many are the dangers we meet;
But Jesus guards and keeps so that nothing can harm us,
And smooth the rugged path for our feet.

3. Though I am often foot-sore and weary from travel,
Though I am often bowed down with care;
A better day is coming when home in the glory,
We'll rest in perfect peace over there.
