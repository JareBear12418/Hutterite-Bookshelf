1. 'I am the vine and ye are the branches,'
Bear precious fruit for Jesus today;
Branches in Him no fruit ever bearing,
Jesus hath said, 'He taketh away.'

Chorus:
'I am the vine and ye are the branches;
I am the vine, be faithful and true;
Ask what ye will, your pray'r shall be granted,
The Father loves Me, so I have loved you.'

2. 'Now ye are clean thro' words I have spoken,
Living in Me, much fruit ye shall bear;
Dwelling in you, My promise unbroken,
Glory in heav'n with Me ye shall share.'

3. Yes, by your fruits the world is to know you,
Walking in love as children of day;
Follow your Guide, He passeth before you,
Leading to realms of glorious day.
