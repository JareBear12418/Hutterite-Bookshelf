1. You said you'd come and share all my sorrows;
You said you'd be there for all my tomorrows;
I came so close to sending you away,
But just like you promised, you came there to stay;
I just had to pray.

Chorus: And Jesus said, 'Come to the water, stand by my side;
I know you are thirsty, you won't be denied.
I felt every teardrop when in darkness you cried,
And I strove to remind you, that for those tears I died.'

2. Your goodness so great, I can't understand,
And dear Lord, I know that all this was planned;
I know you're here now and always will be,
Your love loosed my chains, and in you, I'm free;
But Jesus, why me?

3. Jesus, I give you my heart and my soul,
I know that without God I'd never be whole;
Savior, you opened all the right doors;
And I thank you, and praise you, from earth's humble shore;
Take me, I'm yours.
