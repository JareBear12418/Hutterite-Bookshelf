1. You're young but once;
Are you living in the truth?
Are you living right? Are you in the fight
Of right against the wrong?
Are you hoping now, someway, somehow
Your future will be bright?
Whate'er you sow is what will grow;
You'll reap whate'er you sow.

Chorus: You're on - - - - ly young but once;
(Only young, only young, you're only young but once;)
Then live each day for the Lord,
(Then live each day live it for the Lord, for the Lord)
Embrace the truth while in your youth,
Be faithful brave, be true;
Overcome the wrong, you can be strong
Thro' Christ who strengthens you.  (very true)

2. You're young but once; - Live a life that's full and free.
Are you seeing right? Are you in the light,
The sunshine warm and true?
There's no better way, oh happy day;
Live each day for the Lord.
Whate'er you sow is what will grow,
You'll reap whate'er you sow.

3. You're young but once; - Would you like a happy home,
Of your very own,
Where the light of love is shining from above?
As you lived your youth, this living truth,
Your children follow you.
Whate'er you sow is what will grow,
You'll reap whate'er you sow.
