1. Oh, to be there, where the songs of glory
Float o'er the waves of the bright crystal sea;
This the refrain of the wondrous story,
'Jesus has died for me.'
While still I linger in this world below,
Waiting till homeward I am called to go,
I will repeat o'er and o'er the story,
'Jesus has died for me.'

2. Oh, for a voice to proclaim the message
In ev'ry land and the isles of the sea,
'God's only Son is the friend of sinners,
'Jesus has died for me.'
'Tis but a little that my hands can do
For this dear loving One so kind and true,
But I can tell to the world the story,
'Jesus has died for me.'

3. Now that I've tasted Thy love, O Jesus,
Taken my cross and am following Thee,
Help me to tell this great truth to others,
'Jesus has died for me.'
Oh, that the world would seek the Father's face,
Trust in His mercy and forgiving grace;
Then how all hearts would rejoice in singing,
'Jesus has died for me.'

4. Oh, for a heart that will always love Him,
Trusting His promise wherever I be;
Bearing in mind this sweet truth so precious,
'Jesus has died for me.'
Washed in the blood of Jesus Christ my King,
Thro' endless ages I this song shall sing,
'Glory to God, everlasting glory,
'Jesus has died for me.'
