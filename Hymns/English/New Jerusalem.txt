1. There is a place we read about in God's holy word,
It's built upon a mountain side the new Jerusalem,
The walls around that city are inlaid of pure jewels,
Twelve gates along the walls, in everyone a single pearl.

Chorus:
The glory of that city would blind the human eye,
More glorious still will be the face of Jesus Christ the King,
In garments pure and white as snow we'll gather round His throne;
And join the saints of yesterday in singing 'Home, sweet home'.

2. Inside the city walls, I'm told, are mansions of pure gold,
Where death is banished for all time, we'll never more grow old;
We'll walk beside the river with the lion and the lamb,
Our worries will be gone and everything'll be left behind
