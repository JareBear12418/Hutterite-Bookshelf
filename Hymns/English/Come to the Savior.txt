1. Come to the Savior, make no delay,
Here in His Word He's shown us the way;
Here in our midst He's standing today,
Tenderly saying, 'Come!'

Chorus:
Joyful, joyful, will the meeting be,
When from sin our hearts are pure and free;
And we shall gather, Savior, with Thee,
In our eternal home.

2. 'Suffer the children!' oh, hear His voice!
Let ev'ry heart leap forth and rejoice,
And let us freely make Him our choice,
Do not delay, but come.

3. Think once again, He's with us today;
Heed now His blest commands and obey;
Hear now His accents tenderly say,
'Will you, My children, come?'
