Chorus:
A fountain springing up, a river flowing out,
And whosoever will may come.
Waters that I give you, springing up within you;
You will never thirst again.

1. A fountain springs up in the valley,
Waters deep and crystal clear.
My love for you is like that fountain;
All my springs are in thee.

2. The fountain flows into the river,
Living waters running deep.
The current's moving is so strong,
It will flow eternally.

3. And as we drink these living waters,
Our roots together go down deep.
We'll bear fruit in every season,
For we are planted like a tree.
