1. While standing by an old country church,
I saw a drunkard stagger and lurch,
And as he reached his mother's grave,
I saw the drunkard kneel and pray.

Chorus:
Lord, have mercy on me,
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea,
And as he knelt there on the ground,
I know that God from heaven looked down.

2. Bring my darling boy to me,
Was his mother's dying plea,
And as he staggered through' the gate,
Alas! he came just one day to late.

3. Three years have passed since she went away,
Her son is sleeping beside her today,
And I know in heaven his mother He'll see,
For God has heard the drunkard's plea.
