1. To the river of Jordan, Our Savior went one day,
And we read that John the Baptist met Him there;
And when John baptized Jesus in the Jordan's rushing waters,
The mighty power of God filled the air.

2. I'm on my way (to the river of Jordan,)
Going to wade right in (in the rushing waters;)
I'm going down (to the river of Jordan,)
Let the cool waters cleanse my soul.

3. King Naeman was stricken with dreaded leprosy,
And He sent for the man of God to pray;
But Elijah said to Naeman, 'Go dip yourself in Jordan,'
Let the cool waters wash your spots away.

4. So He went right down (to the river of Jordan,)
He wade right in (in the rushing waters;)
He dipped himself (in the river of Jordan,)
And the cool waters made him whole.

5. The river of Jordan is many miles away,
And this mighty river I may never see;
But I'll find myself an altar in an old fashioned church,
And my river of Jordan that will be.

6. I'm on my way (to the river of Jordan,)
Going to wade right in (in the rushing waters;)
I'm going down (to the river of Jordan,)
Let the cool waters cleanse my soul.
