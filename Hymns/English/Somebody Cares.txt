1. Somebody cares when your heart aches,
Somebody cares when you're blue,
Knows when the dark clouds need rifting,
Letting hope's sunlight shine thru. (shine thru.)

Chorus:
Somebody cares and He sees you
When tears of grief make your eyes dim,
Somebody cares and 'tis Jesus;
Cast all your sorrows on Him.

2. Somebody cares when your trials
Seem too great for you to bear;
Somebody's waiting to comfort,
Wipe away ev'ry sad tear. (sad tear.)

3. Somebody knows when the struggle
Seems too be all but in vain;
Somebody's ready to cheer you,
Help you the vict'ry to gain. (to gain.)

4. Somebody wants to keep near you,
Wants to drive out ev'ry fear,
Wants you to love Him and serve Him,
All of your sorrows He'll share. (He'll share.)
