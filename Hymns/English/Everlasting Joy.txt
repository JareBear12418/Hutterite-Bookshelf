1. My sorrows were so many,
My pleasures were so few,
My heart was always troubled;
And peace I never knew;
Till wholly I surrendered and Jesus took control
He put that everlasting joy down in my soul.

Chorus:
Now I have that everlasting joy within,
Since came Jesus and took away my sins;
The moment that He blessed me, He made me fully whole,
He put that everlasting joy down in my soul.

2. I'm drinking from a fountain That never will run dry,
From the well of living waters
That flows from on high,
I'm feasting of God's Manna and praying everyday,
And that everlasting joy is here to stay.

3. I'm heading for a city
One not made by hand,
I'm crossing over Jordan
To see the promised land,
The water shall be parted and I'll be on my way,
As I cross over Jordan I can say.
