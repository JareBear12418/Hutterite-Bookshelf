1. For God so loved this sinful world,
His Son He freely gave,
That whosoever would believe,
Eternal life should have.

Chorus:
'Tis true, oh, yes, 'tis true, (the promise is true,)
God's wonderful promise is true; ('tis true,)
For I've trusted, and tested, and tried it,
And I know God's promise is true. ('tis true.)

2. I was a wayward, wand'ring child,
A slave to sin and fear,
Until this blessed promise fell
Like music to my ear.

3. The 'Whosoever' of the Lord,
I trusted was for me;
I took Him at His gracious word,
From sin He set me free.

4. Eternal life, begun below,
Now fills my heart and soul;
I'll sing His praise forevermore,
Who has redeemed my soul
