1. A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

Chorus:
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry thirsty land;
He hideth my soul in the depths of his love,
And covers me there with his hand.
And covers me there with his hand.

2. A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength for my day.

3. With numberless blessings each moment he crowns,
And filled with his fullness divine;
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,
For such a redeemer as mine.

4. When clothed in his brightness transported I rise,
To meet him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, his wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high.
