1. Though men may strive to go beyond the reef of space,
To go beyond the distant glimmering stars;
This world's a room so small within my Master's house
The open sky's but a portion of His yard.

Chorus:
How big is God? How big and wide His vast domain
To try and tell these lips can only start;
He's big enough to rule this mighty universe
Yet small enough to live within my heart.

2. As winter's chill may cause the tiny seed to fall,
Or lie asleep till waked by summer's rain.
The heart grown cold, will warm and throb to life anew
The Master's touch will bring the glow again.
