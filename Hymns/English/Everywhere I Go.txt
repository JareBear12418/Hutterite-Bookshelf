Chorus:
Everywhere I go, the Lord is always with me,
Everywhere I go, he's right there by my side;
He is constantly cheering me pressing t'ward the victory,
He is always leading me everywhere I go.

1. Here I am a climber, I'm climbing up the mountain,
I'm searching for that city fair that I can call my home;
Even though the hills are steep, even though the valley's deep,
I've a friend who holds my hand so I'll not climb alone.

2. It's been a long hard journey when trudging thru the darkness,
My sights are set on heaven's door and I'll get there I know;
Though I may be weary and the outlook may be dreary,
The outlook points to victory and Jesus said it's so.
