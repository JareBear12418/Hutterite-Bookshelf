In this world's mighty gallery of pictures,
Hang the scenes that are painted from life.
There are pictures of love and of passion
And there's a picture of peace and of strife.
There hang pictures of youth and of beauty,
Of the old and a blushing young bride.
They all hang on the wall but the saddest of all
Is the picture from life's other side.

CH:Just a picture from life's other side,
Someone that fell by the way.
A life that's gone out with the tide
That might have been happy someday.
There's a poor old mother at home,
She's watching and waiting alone.
Just longing to hear from her loved one so dear.
Just a picture from life's other side.

Now the first scene is that of a gambler
Who has lost all his money at play.
Takes the ring from his dead mother's finger
That she wore on her wedding day.
It's her last earthly treasure but he takes it,
Bows his head that his shame he might hide.
When they lifted his head they found he was dead.
Just a picture from life's other side.

The next tells the tale of two brothers
Whose paths in life different ways had.
While one was in luxury living,
The other one begged for his bread.
One dark night they met on the highway,
Your money or your life the thief cried.
Then he took with his knife, his own brother's life.
Just a picture from life's other side.
