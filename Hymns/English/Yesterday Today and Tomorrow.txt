1. Yesterday He died for me, yesterday, yesterday
Yesterday He died for me, yesterday,
Yesterday He died for me, died for me
This is history.

2. Today He lives for me, today, today,
Today He lives for me, today,
Today He lives for me, lives for me
This is victory.

3. Tomorrow He comes for me, He comes, He comes,
Tomorrow He comes for me, He comes,
Tomorrow He comes for me, comes for me
This is mystery.

4. O friend, do you know Him? know Him? know Him?
O friend, do you know Him? know Him?
O friend, do you know Him? do you know Him?
Jesus Christ the Lord!
