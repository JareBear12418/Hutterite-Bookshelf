1. All my life in sin I roamed, I was lost and so alone,
Till I heard the Gospel story and believed;
This great story came today, about salvation full and free.
Thank God I heard the Gospel story and believed.

Chorus:
Our Savior died for you and me,
(Savior died for you and me,)
He shed His blood to cleanse and make us free;
(Shed His blood to make us free;)
He suffered all the awful pain of Calvary,
O Sinner, hear the Gospel Glory and believe.

2. When our life on earth shall cease, In the tower He'll give us peace
If we've heard the Gospel story and believed;
When we reach the golden strand, He will take us by the hand
When we have heard the Gospel story and believed.
