1. Though I was not there, (Though I was not there,)
Yet I believe, (Yet I believe,)
That my Lord was crucified, my sins to release;
Though I did not see (Though I did not see)
I know it is true (I know it is true)
That my Lord gave his life for me and for you.

Chorus:
Humbly up Calvary,
The Lamb was led,
He raised His sad eyes to God;
And to Him He said,
'Oh, Lord, if it be Thy will,
Oh, save Thou me,
But if I must die for sin
Then so let it be.'
