1. Soon I'll come to the end of life's journey,
And I'll meet the one who gave His life for me;
I will thank Him for the love that He gave me,
And ten thousand years or more I'll praise His name.

Chorus:
Ten thousand years and we'll just be started,
Ten thousand years and we've just begun;
The battle's over and the victory is won,
Ten, thousand years and we've only just begun.

2. We will just begin to sing love's sweet story,
It's a song that the angels cannot sing;
I'm redeemed by the blood of my Savior,
And ten thousand years or more I'll praise His name.
