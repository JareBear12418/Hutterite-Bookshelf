1. There's a path we all can take as life we're living;
In the law of love, for God sincere;
As He fills our hearts with love and love we're giving,
We will walk in love and never need to fear.

Chorus: Walk in love let love surround you,
(Walk in love surround you)
As it flows from heav'n above.
(As it flows from heav'n above)
Walk in love with those around you,
(Walk in love with those around you)
For a life that's worth living, walk in love.
(walk in love)

2. Love is undisturbed when thoughtless words they're saying,
Love forgives in prayerful word and deed;
In your heart and on your knees just keep on praying;
Walk in love with Him who fills our ev'ry need.

3. Keep the fire of love aflame and ever burning,
With a touch of heaven ev'ry day;
And your path will glow with love, and love returning
Will grow brighter as you journey on.
