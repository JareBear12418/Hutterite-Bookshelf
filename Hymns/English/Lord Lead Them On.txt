1. In union, Lord, two hearts have met
To walk this pilgrim way.
Two hands are clasped in one accord,
In love they will obey.

Chorus: We pray, dear Lord, to lead them on,
Grant them a peace so calm.
Help them to prove thy will,
O Lord, keep them within thy palm.

2. We do not know, we cannot tell,
Where thou would'st want to lead;
Help them to say, 'Oh yes, dear Lord:'
Fill thou their ev'ry need.

3. Give them a home where love's supreme,
A radiance from within.
A home that gives unselfishly,
The wand'rer might turn in.

4. Lead thou them on o'er hill and vale,
Until the set of sun;
And when they come before thy throne,
Thy words might be, 'Well done:'
