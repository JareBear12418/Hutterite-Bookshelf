1. I don't know about you my friend
I don't know when the journey will end;
But for me and all of mine,
We're going to walk that heavenly climb.

Chorus:
Up to that heavenly shore, We'll live forever more,
Never have a trial, never have a care,
Everything will just be happiness there;
Sweeter gets the journey everyday,
Serving Jesus really pays,
I get happy in a heavenly way
Sweeter gets the journey everyday.

2. 'Troubles and sorrows used to be my lot,
I'd sit and worry about the things I've not;
Now I'm counting the blessings I've got,
I don't worry about the things I've not.

3. Some folks seek and never find,
Happiness and peace of mine;
I have peace within my heart
Since with the Savior I've made my start.
