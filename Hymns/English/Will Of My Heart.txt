1. Let your spirit be greater than forces on Earth
Stronger than the will of my heart
Let temptation not take me from your perfect plan
Be stronger than the will of my heart

2. Let not person or object nor intangible things
Take my focus from where it belongs
Keep me straight as an arrow
As an arrow can fly
Hold me close don't let my heart die

Chorus: And with a God up in heaven who promises strength
I can live through my days being full and content
When that gentle voice says turn away and depart
I let Jesus be stronger than the will of my heart

3. Your truth you desire in my secret heart
Wisdom to the depths of my soul
Restore to me the joy that salvation brings
A willing heart you will uphold

4. Like the one who was lost he hears the voice far away
A Sheppard is calling His lamb
Like a river of mercy like an ocean of love
Taking me just as I am
(Repeat Chorus)
