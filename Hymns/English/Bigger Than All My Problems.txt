1. Bigger than all my problems bigger than all my fears
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see
Bigger than all my questions bigger than anything
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see.

2. Bigger than all the shadows that fall across my path
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see
Bigger than all confusion bigger than anything
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see.

3. Bigger than all the giants of fear and unbelief
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see
Bigger than all my hang ups bigger than anything
God is bigger than any mountain that I can or cannot see.
