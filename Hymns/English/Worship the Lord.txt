1. Raising our hands as a sign of rejoicing,
And with our lips our togetherness voicing,
Giving ourselves to a life of creativeness,
Worship and work must be one!

Chorus:
Worship the Lord, worship the Father, the Spirit, the Son,
Raising our hands in devotion to Him who is One.

2. Praying and training that we be a blessing,
And by our workmanship daily expressing
We are committed to serving humanity,
Worship and work must be one!

3. Calling to be partners with God in creation,
Honoring Christ as the Lord of the nation,
We must be ready for risk and for sacrifice,
Worship and work must be one!

4. Bringing the bread and the wine to the table,
Asking that we may be led and enabled,
Truly united, to find a new brotherhood,
Worship and work must be one!

5. Now in response to the life You are giving,
Help us, O Father, to offer our living,
Seeking a just and a healing society,
Worship and work must be one!
