1. I have tasted of freedom,
I can go where He's leading,
For shackles can hold me no more;
I have heard of life's essence,
And I stand in His presence
And sing with my heart, 'He is Lord'.

Chorus:
Keep silent ye mountains
Ye fields and ye fountains,
For this is the time I must sing;
Its the time to sing praises,
To the Rock of the Ages,
For this is the time I must sing.

2. There are days filled with sorrow,
And plans for tomorrow,
But this is the time I must sing;
And I know there's a reason,
Why in His own season,
God gives me a song, I can sing.

3. If the rocks would cry out,
Should His praises die out,
Then the stones would keep silent as long;
As I've breath for the singing,
His praise will keep ringing,
And I will keep singing my song.
