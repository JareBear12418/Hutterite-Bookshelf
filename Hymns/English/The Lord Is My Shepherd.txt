1. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want;
He maketh me down to lie
In pastures green, He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

Chorus:
His yoke is easy, His burden is light,
I've found it so, I've found it so;
He leadeth me by day and by night,
Where living waters flow.

2. My soul crieth out: 'Restore me again,
And give me the strength to take
The narrow path of righteousness,
E'en for His own name's sake.'

3. Yea, tho' I should walk the valley of death,
Yet why should I fear from ill?
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.
