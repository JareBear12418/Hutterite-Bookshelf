Tears are a language only God understands;
Though oft' led to thinking 'my life's all in vain.'
But let us not question; let Him be our strength,
For one day in Glory 'twill all be our gain.

CH:    We may not see or understand,
Dear Lord, the uncontrolled tears of man;
The trials and heartaches we here must bear.
We prayerfully plea, Lord help us see, 'tis all Your plan.

When our friends forsake us for doing Thy will,
When all seems to tumble from mountain and hill,
We hear your sweet whisper, 'Be silent and still.'¬ù
You send reassurance, our needs all fulfill.
