1. Bless, O Lord, this happy couple,
Who before Thee stand;
May they have Thy blessing daily,
Walking hand in hand.

2. May true love which comes from Jesus
Fill their hearts today;
May they feel His presence near them,
Keeping them always.

3. Help them solve all earthly problems,
Bringing them to Thee;
Grant that in Thy holy wisdom
They may happy be.

4. Then when Jesus comes in glory,
May they with Him shine;
Living in that Heavenly Kingdom,
In that life sublime.
