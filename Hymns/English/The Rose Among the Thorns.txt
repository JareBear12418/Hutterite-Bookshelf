1. While strolling through the fields of time
There's many things to see,
But nature is the greatest sight,
There could ever be;
The greatest of them all to me
Is how the world was born,
And why the roses have to live,
Each day among the thorns.

Chorus:
One day among a world of thorns
A rose begins to grow,
It was the greatest gift of God
This world will ever know;
It was the will of God to show
That since the world was born,
There had to be a rose to live
And die among the thorns.

2. Along the road to Jericho
A man was left to die,
There like a petal from the rose
Two men passed him by;
A neighbor and a friend came by
And saw his lifeless form,
With love he took care of him
The rose among the thorns

3. Two thousand years will soon be gone,
Since God looked down in love,
There in the town of Bethlehem,
A rose began to bud;
It lived to bloom until one day
Was crushed with awful crowns,
And then in love from God above
Was moved to higher ground.
