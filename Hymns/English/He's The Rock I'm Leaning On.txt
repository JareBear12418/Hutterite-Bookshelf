1. If you don't care much about him,
And the things he's done for you,
If his Word you take for granted,
And you don't believe it's true.
If the blood he shed on Calvary
Won't melt your heart of stone,
Please don't criticize him,
He's the rock I'm leaning on.

Chorus:
He's the rock of my salvation,
He's my refuge from the storm.
In sorrow he's my comfort,
He's the reason I was born.
He's the one I can depend on,
When all my friends are gone;
So please don't criticize him,
He's the rock I'm leaning on.

2. Friend, he could be your Savior,
And he could be your dearest friend.
While, at your door he's knocking,
If you'd only let him in.
He could be your strength and courage,
When you feel like you're alone.
So please don't criticize him,
He's the rock I'm leaning on.
