Chorus:
Go, tell it on the mountains,
Over the hills and ev'rywhere;
Go tell it on the mountains
That Jesus Christ is born!

1. While shepherds kept their watching
O'er silent flocks by night,
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.

2. The shepherds feared and trembled
When Lo! above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Savior's birth.

3. Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born,
And brought us God's salvation
That blessed Christmas morn.
