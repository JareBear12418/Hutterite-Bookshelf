1. There is a happy land of sunshine, I know,
Free from all sorrow, pain and care;
(from pain and care the blessed)
Land where no chilling winds of death ever blow,
(It is) Springtime forever there.

Chorus:
Springtime in glory, (always) springtime in glory,
(Where the) flowers are blooming rich and rare;
(Where happy) Angels are singing,
(Bells of) glory are ringing,
(It is) Springtime forever there.

2. Youthful and happy, none will ever grow old,
Out in that lovely land so fair;
(so bright and fair, the land where)
There is no suffering from hunger or cold, so rich and rare;
(It is) Springtime forever there.

3. There is no weeping in that home of the soul,
No death to bring to us despair;
(to us despair, the land where)
All will be glory while the ages shall roll,
(It is) Springtime forever there.
