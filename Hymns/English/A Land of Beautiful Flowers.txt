1. I know there is a land of beautiful flowers,
Where we will meet at the end when life is o'er;
Where we will wipe away the useless hours,
On heaven's bright eternal shore.

Chorus:
The prettiest sets of flowers blooming,
(Prettiest sets of flowers blooming,)
By the prettiest trees our eyes shall ever behold,
Where the beautiful tree of Life for us is waiting
(Beautiful tree of Life of us is waiting)
By the prettiest man - sion made of pur - est gold.
(Prettiest mansion made of purest gold,)
The prettiest ro - be and crowns we'll all be wearing,
(Prettiest robe and crowns we'll all be wearing,)
In the city for square beyond this world of strife,
(City for square beyond this world of strife)
And the prettiest song with the angles we'll be singing,
(Prettiest song with the angels we'll be singing,)
On the beautiful morn - ing by the River of Life.
(Beautiful morning by the Ri - ver of Life.)

2. On heaven's golden strand there'll be no dying,
No chilling winds are tempt to spare real blow;
It is the land of love and wondrous beauty,
Where precious flowers ever grow.
