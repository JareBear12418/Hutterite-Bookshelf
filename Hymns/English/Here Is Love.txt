1. Here is love, vast as the ocean,
Loving kindness as the flood,
When the Prince of Life, our ransom,
Shed for us His precious blood.
Who His love will not remember?
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten,
Throughout heav'n's eternal days.

2. On the mount of crucifixion,
Fountains opened deep and wide;
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
Poured incessant from above,
And heav'n's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.

3. Let me all thy love accepting,
Love thee, ever all my days;
Let me seek thy kingdom only
And my life be to thy praise;
Thou alone shalt be my glory,
Nothing in the world I see.
Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me,
Thou thyself hast set me free.

4. In thy truth thou dost direct me
By thy Spirit through thy Word;
And thy grace my need is meeting,
As I trust in thee, my Lord.
Of thy fullness thou art pouring
Thy great love and power on me,
Without measure, full and boundless,
Drawing out my heart to thee.
