1. We now greet you, brothers, sisters,
Well beloved in the Lord,
Who from near and far, united,
Dwell in Christ, in sweet accord.
Be ye welcome, All ye faithful,
In the name of Christ the Lord!

2. O the peace of holy greetings
That from heart to heart proceed.
If the greeting peace is bringing,
Then it is a prayer indeed!
Love is in it, Peace within it,
God's own greeting in the Lord!

3. Greet the members of His body;
Pray that Zion e'er may thrive;
Greet ye those in joy, in sorrow,
Those who here 'mid trials strive
Let the meeting, By the greeting,
Be a blessing in the Lord!

4. Farewell greeting, holy fervor,
On this earth our lot is tears;
Yet a heartfelt understanding
Is love's final greeting here.
Resurrection and reunion,
Blessed greeting in the Lord!
