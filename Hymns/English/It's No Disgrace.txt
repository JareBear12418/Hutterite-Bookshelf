Chorus: It's no disgrace if you make a mistake;
It's not a shame if you fall.
I want to tell you a secret,
:.: My love has covered it all.:.:

1. I met a woman whom they wanted to kill,
So I said, 'Stone her, if you will.'
But then don't hide, the truth of your pride;
Your sin is greater still.
Then she looked at me and she knew why I smiled;
She was simple enough to believe like a child.

2. I met a robber who was dying like me,
Broken and battered and tied to a tree.
Alone and forsaken, he started to cry,
I turned at his call, and I let him know why.
Then he looked at me, and he knew why I smiled;
He was lonely enough to believe like a child.

3. I've been around when you've carried inside,
All the weight of your guilt and your pride.
And I've waited until you could see,
My love has set you free.
When you look at me, you'll know why I smile,
If you're simple enough to believe like a child.
