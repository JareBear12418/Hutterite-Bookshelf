The blessed Saviour wrote my name when I was born again,
He wrote it when He saved my soul.
He wrote that I had made aright my every sinful wrong.
He wrote my name on Heaven's scroll.

CH:He wrote my name, (My name,)
Way up (Way up) in Glory. (In Glory land.)
He saved my soul (Jesus saved my soul)
From sin and shame. (From all sin and shame.)
I never shall (I never shall) forget that day, (Forget that day,)
The blessed Saviour wrote my name. (He wrote my name.)

If I should live a thousand years upon this earth below,
I never could forget that day,
That Jesus wrote my name within the blessed book of life,
And took my many sins away.
