1. Struggling through this life of sins and sorrows
We're trusting Jesus every day
Watching for that happy bright tomorrow
When Jesus comes to fetch His bride away.

Chorus: Keep your eyes on Jesus
When the tidal waves of trouble around you roll
Keep your eyes on Jesus
He will calm the storms of life that toss your row

2. When your life you're living is not worth living
I know one who cares and understands
He will cleanse your heart and make you happy
And lead you to that home not made by hand.
