1. Just one life to live on earth, and it swiftly passes by,
From the moment of our birth 'til our time has come to die;
God has given us this choice to decide our destiny;
In a million years, where will you be?

Chorus:
Where will you be a million years from now?
Will you be happy? Will you be singing?
While ages roll throughout eternity,
I ask this question, where will you be?

2. In the Bible we are told of a day that soon will come,
When the people of this earth will be gathered at God's throne;
And the books are open wide there for all the world to see;
Will He say 'Well done?' Where will you be?
