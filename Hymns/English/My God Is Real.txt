1. He speaks the words that we believe upon His promise,
He fills our hungry hearts and souls so deep within.
Yes, I'm so glad, He's our beloved Father;
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul.

Chorus: My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul,
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul;
Yes, I thank Him that we have life eternal;
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul.

2. He heals the sick, the lame can walk, the blind can see;
He gave His life and shed His blood for you and me.
If not for Him we'd have no place in heaven;
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul.

3. He was a pawn in the plan that was so full of evil,
He went about His Father's work with love and care,
He was so full of the love of God it shone about Him;
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul.
