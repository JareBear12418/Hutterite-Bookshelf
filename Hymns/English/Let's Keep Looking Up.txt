1. The day is growing darker and the sun is sinking low
The songbirds cease their singing for they know
Today is gone it's gone for good we can't turn back the time
Tomorrow is the future we must find.

2. Sometimes the day seems much too long as if it had no end
Sometimes it seems so dark that we can't see
But there can't be a darker day as that of long ago
The day they nailed our Savior to the tree.
Chorus
Let's keep looking up and search for heaven's beauty
There's a rainbow in the sky somewhere beyond
For if we live accordingly to Matthew, Luke and John
We'll see Jesus in His glory calling us to be His own.

4. So I'll Just try to live for Him and do His blessed will
And pray for courage all along the way
Though times seem hard and days seem dark this can't eternal be
For paradise is what someday we'll see.
