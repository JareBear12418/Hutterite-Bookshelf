1. There is coming a day
When no heartache shall come
No more clouds in the sky
No more tears to dim the eye
All is peace forevermore
On that happy golden shore
What a day, glorious day that will be.

Chorus: What a day that will be
When my Jesus I shall see
And I look upon His face
The one who saved me by His grace
When He takes me by the hand
And leads me through the Promised Land
What a day, glorious day that will be.

2. There'll be no sorrow there
No more burdens to bear
No more sickness, no pain
No more parting over there
And forever I will be
With the one who died for me?
What a day, glorious day that will be.
