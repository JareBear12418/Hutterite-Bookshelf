1. Walking in sunlight, all of my journey,
Over the mountains, through the deep vale;
Jesus has said, 'I'll never forsake thee,'
Promise divine that never can fail.

Chorus:
Heavenly sunlight, heavenly sunlight,
Flooding my soul with glory divine;
Hallelujah! I am rejoicing,
Singing His praises, Jesus is mine.

2. Shadows around me, shadows above me,
Never conceal my Savior and Guide;
He is the Light, in Him is no darkness;
Ever I'm walking close to His side.

3. In the bright sunlight, ever rejoicing,
Pressing my way to mansions above;
Singing His praises, gladly I'm walking,
Walking in sunlight, sunlight of love
