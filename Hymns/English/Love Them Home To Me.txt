1. Can you see them standing there,
The lame, the blind, the sinner?
Go and tell them that I care,
Invite them to my heaven.

Chorus: Look at them through my eyes, see them as I do;
Go out into the world and bring them back with you.
Love them home to me,
and let my love be all they see in you;
And when you do, you will love them home to me,
Where they long to be.
I've shown you the way, so love them home to me.

2. Can you see them standing there,
The widow and the poor man?
I've given you so much to share,
Give to them what you can.
