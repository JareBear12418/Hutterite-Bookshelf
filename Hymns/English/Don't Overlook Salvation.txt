1. Heaven is a city, built of jewels so rare,
It's beauties are of splendor yet untold,
But if you neglect salvation
You'll never enter in,
And you'll never ever walk those streets of gold.

Chorus:
Don't overlook salvation, while living here in sin,
For someday it may be too late to pray;
And someday when you'll need Him
He may not let you in,
How awful if He should turn you away.

2. Sometimes you feel discouraged as you walk this lonely road,
But Jesus said, He'll every burden bare;
So take Him all your troubles,
When it seems all hope is gone,
Just trust Him when you go to Him in prayer.

3. Jesus said, be ready, for we know not what the hour,
For He may come at morning, night or noon;
So keep your eyes upon Him,
And your heart filled with His love,
For we know that He is surely coming soon.
