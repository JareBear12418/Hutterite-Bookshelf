1. All you that mourn in Zion
I have authority;
To appoint unto you in Zion,
Oil of joy that will set you free.

Chorus:
Put on your garments of praise
For the spirit of happiness,
Lift up your voice to God
Praise with the spirit
And with understanding
O, magnify the Lord.

2. Lift up the hands that hang down,
Lift up the voice now still;
Give unto God continuous praise
Sing forth from Zion's hill.

3. Sing to Yay-Wey hallelujah,
Worship and praise our God;
Praise and adore Him, bow down before Him,
O, Magnify the Lord.
