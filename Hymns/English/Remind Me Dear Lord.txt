1. The things that I love, and hold dear to my heart,
Are just borrowed they're not mine at all;
Jesus only lets us use them, to brighten my life,
So remind me, remind me, dear Lord.

Chorus:
Roll back the curtain of memories now and then
Show me where you brought me from,
And, where I could have been,
Remember I'm human and humans forget
So remind me, remind me, dear Lord.

2. Nothing good have I done, to deserve God's own Son,
I'm not worthy of the scars in His hands;
Yet He chose the road to Calvary to die in my stead
Why He loves me, I can't understand.
