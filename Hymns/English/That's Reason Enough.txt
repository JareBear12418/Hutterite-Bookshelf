1. If heaven had no splendor for my eyes to see
And if I had no loved ones there waiting for me,
Still I would have a longing and I'd still want to go,
For Jesus is there and that is all I need to know.

Chorus:
And that's reason enough for me to walk the narrow way,
Yes, that's reason enough to face each trial that comes my way.
And if that holy city wasn't glittering and fair,
Then I'd still want to go, because Jesus is there.

2. And if there were no river that flows from the throne,
And if there were no angel bands to make me feel at home,
And if I knew my visit there would only last awhile,
Oh, just to see the Lamb of God would make everything worthwhile.
