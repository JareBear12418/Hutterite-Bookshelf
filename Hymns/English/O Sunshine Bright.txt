1. O sunshine bright, whose golden rays shine into our poor hearts;
You give us light on all our ways, and pain from us departs.
The night retreats and darkness flees when warmly shines the Sun,
And joy and bliss untold will seize the hearts where once was none.

Chorus:
O Love divine, so full and free,
(O Love divine, so full and free,)
Poured out for you, Poured out for me!
(Poured out for you, Poured out for me!)
Age after age It comes anew
(Age after age It comes anew)
And draws us near Our Savior true.

2. When from the Cross this Love divine shone in my night of sin,
My heart awoke to see it shine I knew who loved me then.
And since the day I knew His love had suffered death for me,
My heart belongs to Him above and sings His praises free.

3. The Sun that shines so bright for me is my Emmanuel;
He is to all eternity the One I love so well.
To Him I sing my joyful song down here on earth below;
And then above in angel throng my praise shall overflow.
