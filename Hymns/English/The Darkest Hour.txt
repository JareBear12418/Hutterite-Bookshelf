1. The sun is slowly sinking,
The day is almost gone;
The darkness falls all around us.
And we must journey on.

Chorus:
The darkest hour is just before dawn,
The narrow way leads home;
Lay down your soul at Jesus' gate
The darkest hour is just before dawn.

2. Like a shepherd out on the Mountain,
Are watching the sheep down below;
He's coming back to claim us
Will you be ready to go.
