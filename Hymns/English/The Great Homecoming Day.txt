1. There are many things in life that we cherish so dear,
Many things that to us seems so grand.
But nothing that I have here on earth, can compare
To the joys that wait for me in that land.

Chorus:
Oh! What a great homecoming, what a day that will be!
When at last the Savior's face I shall see.
Where Satan cannot enter, from sin we'll be free.
What a great homecoming day that will be!

2. Now we know that life's uncertain, and death seems so sure,
And we know that death can come any day.
But there's not one thing to dread when it's my time to go,
For he took the sting of death away.
