1. Eve, don't you know,
That God loved you so,
He only asked, 'Do not disobey,'
He gave you the world
What were you thinking, girl,
To let the devil take it all away.

Chorus:
Don't eat the fruit in the garden, Eve,
It wasn't in God's natural plan;
You were only a rib and look at what you did
To Adam the father of man.

2. Eve, I've heard it said,
That no one would be dead,
If only you had picked the other tree;
From the garden you were barred
There's an angel standing guard,
To protect the tree of Life eternally.
