1. All hail to Thee, Immanuel,
We cast our crowns before Thee;
Let ev'ry heart obey Thy will,
And ev'ry voice adore Thee,
In praise to Thee, our Savior King,
The vibrant chords of Heaven ring,
And echo back the mighty strain
All hail! (All hail) all hail! (all hail!)
All hail! all hail! Immanuel!

Chorus:
Hail to the King we love so well! Hail! Immanuel!
Hail to the King we love so well! Hail! Immanuel!
Glory and honor and majesty,
Wisdom and power be unto Thee,
Now and evermore!
Hail to the King we love so well! Hail! Immanuel!
Hail to the King we love so well! Hail! Immanuel!
King of kings and Lord of lords,
All hail, Immanuel!

2. All hail to Thee, Immanuel,
The ransomed hosts surround Thee;
And earthly monarchs clamor forth
Their Sov'reign King to crown Thee,
While those redeemed in ages gone,
Assembled round the great white throne,
Break forth into immortal song:
All hail! (All hail) all hail! (all hail!)
All hail! all hail! Immanuel!

3. All hail to Thee, Immanuel,
Our risen King and Savior!
Thy foes are vanquished, and Thou art
Omnipotent forever,
Death, sin, and hell no longer reign,
And Satan's pow'r is burst in twain;
Eternal glory to Thy Name:
All hail! (All hail) all hail! (all hail!)
All hail! all hail! Immanuel!
