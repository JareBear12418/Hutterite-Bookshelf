1. Up Calvary's mountain one dreadful morn,
Walked Christ my Savior, weary and worn;
Facing for sinners death on the cross,
That He might save them from endless loss.

Chorus:
Blessed Redeem - er! precious Redeem - er!
(Blessed Redeemer! blessed Redeemer!)
Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree;
Wounded and bleed - ing, for sinners plead - ing
(Wounded and bleeding for sinners pleading)
Blind and unheed - - ing dying for me!
(Blind and unheeding)

2. 'Father, forgive them!' thus did He pray,
E'en while His lifeblood flowed fast away;
Praying for sinners while in such woe
No one but Jesus ever loved so.

3. O how I love Him, Savior and Friend,
How can my praises ever find end!
Thro' years unnumbered on heaven's shore,
My tongue shall praise Him forevermore.
