While kneeling by my bed one night
To say a sinner's prayer,
I looked up through tear-filled eyes
And saw my savior there.

Chorus:
To me he said don't be alarmed
As he was standing there
To me he said with outstretched arm
My child I hear your prayer.
2.
You ask me how I know Christ lives
I'll tell you how I know
I saw the nail scars in his hands
And robe as white as snow.
3.
I'll follow Jesus all the way
He died upon the cross
I'll follow Jesus all the way
Because he paid the cost.
