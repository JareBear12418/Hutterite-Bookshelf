1. Children of the heav'nly King,
As we journey let us sing,
Sing our Savior's worthy praise,
Glorious in His works and ways.

Chorus:
We are trav - 'lling home to God,
(We are trav'lling home, trav'lling home to God
In the way Our fathers trod,
(In the narrow way, way our fathers trod)
They are hap - py now, and we,
(They are happy now, happy now, and we)
Soon their happiness shall see.

2. Lift your eyes, ye sons of light
Zion's city is in sight;
There our endless home shall be,
There our Lord we soon shall see.

3. Fear not, brothers, joyful stand
On the borders of our land;
Jesus Christ, our Father's Son,
Bids us undismayed go on.

4. Lord, obediently we'll go,
Gladly leaving all below:
Only Thou our Leader be,
And we still will follow Thee.
