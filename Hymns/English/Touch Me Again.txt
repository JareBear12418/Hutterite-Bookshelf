1. Touch me again, Lord,  - I need your power,
I need your strength,  - In this trying hour.
You said if I'd ask - I will surely receive,
So touch me again, Lord, that's what I need.

Chorus: Touch me again, Lord,
Touch me again, Lord,
Let the manna fall from on high,
Wherever I'm going you've already been,
So I ask you to touch me again.

2. Touch me again, Lord,  - I see that mountain;
Touch me again, Lord,  - Let me feel that fountain.
Come Holy Spirit, -  Let the heavens descend,
Then touch me again, Lord,  - Touch me again.
