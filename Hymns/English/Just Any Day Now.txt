1. Each time I stop and take the time to look around me
I see the signs of His appearing everywhere
The things He said would come to pass are now before us
And I can feel a strange excitement in the air.
Chorus;
Just any day now, our Lord is coming
He'll be returning, for you and me
Oh, I've been watching, and I've been waiting
Just any day now ,His face I'll see.

2. There's this longing in my heart for His appearing
I'll gladly leave behind each trial here below
For this journey has been hard and I'm so weary
Oh, Lord I feel I'm so much closer home.
