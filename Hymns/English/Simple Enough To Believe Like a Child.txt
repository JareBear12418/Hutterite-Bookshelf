1. I met a woman who they wanted to kill
So I said stone her if you will
But then don't hide the truth of your pride
Your sin is greater still
Then she looked at me, and she knew I had smiled
She was simple enough to believe like a child.

Chorus:
It's no disgrace if you make a mistake
It's not a shame if you fall
I want to tell you a secret; my love has covered it all
My love has covered it all.

2. I met a robber who was dying like me
Broken and tattered and tied to a tree
Alone and forsaken he started to cry
I turned at his fall and let him know why
Then he looked at me, and knew I had smiled
He was lonely enough to believe like a child.

3. I've been around when you carried inside
All the weight of your gilt and your pride
And I've waited until you could see
My love has set you free
When you looked at me, and knew I had smiled
If your simple enough to believe like a child.

Chorus:
It's no disgrace if you make a mistake
It's not a shame if you fall
I want to tell you a secret, my love has covered it all
My love has covered it all
My love has covered it all
My blood has covered it all.
