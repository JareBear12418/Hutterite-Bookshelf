1. I'm only human, I'm just a man
Help me believe in what I could be
And all that I am
Show me the stairway, I have to climb
Lord for my sake teach me to take one day at a time.

Chorus: One day at a time sweet Jesus
That's all I'm asking from you
Just give me the strength to do every day
what I have to do
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus
And tomorrow may never be mine
So help me today show me the way one day at a time.

2. Do you remember when you walked among men
Well Jesus you know if you're looking below
It's worse now than then
Pushing and shoving crowding my mind
So for my sake Lord teach me to take one day at a time.
