1. I'm satisfied with just a cottage below,
A little silver and a little gold;
But in that city where the ransomed will shine,
I want a gold one that's silver lined.

Chorus:
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop,
In that bright land where we'll never grow old;
And some day yonder we will nevermore wander,
But walk the streets that are purest gold.

2. Though often tempted, tormented and tested,
And, like the prophet, my pillow a stone,
And though I find here no permanent dwelling,
I know He'll give me a mansion my own.

3. Don't think me poor or deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged, I'm heaven bound;
I'm just a pilgrim in search of a city,
I want a mansion, a harp and a crown.
