1. Sometimes I feel discouraged, I cannot understand
The way the Father leads me, the way that He has planned;
But you know best, oh Lord, so draw me close to thee,
That I may feel your heartbeat bringing life to me.

Chorus: The heartbeat of God means life and love to me;
I don't want to be in doubt and troubled misery;
So draw me closer, Father, up above,
That I may always feel your heartbeat of love.

2. Sometimes I live for self and often far away,
But I'm the one who slips and I'm the one to stray;
Oh Father, please forgive each failure as I pray,
And let me feel your presence every passing day.

3. By faith I'll step right up and stand by Jesus' side,
To feel the beat of love and there to safely hide;
And I will trust in Him to see me safely through,
Until in heaven with Jesus, oh so real and true.
