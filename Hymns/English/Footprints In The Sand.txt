1. One night I had a dream, I was walking on the beach,
There were two sets of footprints in the sand.
One belonged to me, the other to my Lord,
He was walking close beside me thru the sand.

2. Then I noticed something, when paths were hard to bear,
Only one set of footprints in the sand.
I said, 'Lord, why did you leave me along life's weary way
Just when I needed you most?'

3. He said, 'Child, I never left you along life's weary way,
For I've been close beside you everyday;
When you saw one set of footprints instead of two,
My child, that's when I carried you:'
