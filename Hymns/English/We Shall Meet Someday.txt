1. How our hearts ache with grief, as we say good-bye.
We shall meet (shall meet) someday,
In the city of rest, on the other side,
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.

Chorus:
We shall meet (shall meet) where no storm clouds gather.
We shall meet (shall meet) someday,
By the river of life, sparkling cool and clear,
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.

2. When we've all crossed the stream with its rolling tide,
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.
Where no sorrow or tears ever dim the eye,
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.

3. What a glorious thought, as we say good-bye,
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.
In that beautiful home that's prepared on high,
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.
