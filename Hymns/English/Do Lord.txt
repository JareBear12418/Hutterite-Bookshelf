1. I've got a home in gloryland that outshines the sun,
I've got a home in gloryland that outshines the sun,
I've got a home in gloryland that outshines the sun,
Way beyond the blue.

Chorus:
Do, Lord - O do, Lord - O do remember me,
Do, Lord - O do, Lord - O do remember me,
Do, Lord - O do, Lord - O do remember me,
Way beyond the blue.

2. I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too,
I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too,
I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too,
While He's calling you.
