1. I was in sins' prison, O so dark and cold,
Just a lost sheep wandering from God's eternal fold;
Then the door swung open, Jesus said to me,
'I have signed your pardon now you may go free.'

Chorus:
Jesus signed my pardon this I surely know,
Took my place on Calvary, now I don't have to go;
All my life I gave Him, He gave His to me,
When He signed my pardon there on Calvary.

2. Since the Savior led me from that awful place,
I can hear the angels sing, they sang, Amazing Grace;
I know that I was pardoned from my awful sin,
Now I go on singing glory to His name.

3. Life is now worth living since He set me free,
I know He was willing to save a wretch like me;
Now I own a mansion, not a prison wall,
For He signed my pardon, yes, He paid it all.
