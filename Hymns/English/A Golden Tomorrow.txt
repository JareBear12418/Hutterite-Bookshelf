1. As I rest at the close of a long, weary day
And I think of the trials that passed o'er my way;
It seems I can hear a small voice seem to say,
'There's a Golden Tomorrow just over the way.' (just over the way.)

Chorus:
There's a Golden Tomorrow just waiting for me
Where in peace I shall rest with the happy and free;
Oh, there'll be no more sorrow or heartache for me,
In that Golden Tomorrow how happy I'll be. (how happy I'll be.)

2. In that Golden Tomorrow what joy we will share
As we dwell in that beautiful city foursquare;
Oh, what rapture I'll find as I wonder up there
And I'll gaze on the face of my Savior so fair. (my Savior so fair.)

3. Oh I hardly can wait till I reach that far shore
Where I'll see all the loved ones who've gone on before;
And we'll sing all the beautiful anthems of yore
In that Golden Tomorrow we'll part nevermore. (we'll part nevermore.)
