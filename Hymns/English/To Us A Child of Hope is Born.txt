1. To us a child of hope is born
To us a son is giv'n.
Him shall the tribes of earth obey
Him all the hosts of heav'n.

2. His name shall be the Prince of Peace,
Forevermore adored.
The Wonderful, the Counselor,
The great and mighty Lord.

3. His pow'r increasing, still shall spread,
His reign no end shall know;
Justice shall guard His throne above,
And peace abound below.
