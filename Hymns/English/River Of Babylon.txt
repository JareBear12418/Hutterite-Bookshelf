Chorus:
By the river of Babylon,
There we sat down;
There we wept,
When we remember Zion.

1. Let the wicked carry us away in captivity,
Requiring to us the song;
Now how shall we sing the Lord's song,
In a strange land.

2. Let the words of our mouths
And the meditation of our hearts;
Be acceptable in thy sight,
Here tonight.
