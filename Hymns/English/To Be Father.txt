1. Like a beautiful rainbow, your days are to me,
Tho you feel the rain it's the rainbow I see;
And all of the love that I pour all around
Is like rain giving life to the seed in the ground.

Chorus:
To be Father is to support you,
To be Shepherd is to protect you,
To be Mighty is to uphold you
To be Me is to love you.

2. Like a radiant sunburst, your days are to me
Tho you feel the heat it's the light that I see;
And tho you may stumble and tho you may fall,
Just to walk in Thy power since I've done it all.

3. Like a rose in the morning your days are to me,.
Tho you feel the thorns its the beauty I see;
And all of the joy that you spread on your way,
Are the gifts that are borne from the words that I say.
