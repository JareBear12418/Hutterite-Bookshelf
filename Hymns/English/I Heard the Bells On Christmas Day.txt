1. I heard the bells on Christmas Day,
Their old familiar carols play;
And wild and sweet the words repeat,
Of 'Peace on earth, goodwill to men.'

2. I thought how as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom;
Had rolled along, the unbroken song,
Of 'Peace on earth, goodwill to men.'

3. And in despair I bowed my head,
'There is no peace on earth,' I said,
'For hate is strong and mocks the song,
Of 'Peace on earth, goodwill to men.'

4. Then pealed the bells more loud and deep,
'God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With Peace on earth, goodwill to men.
