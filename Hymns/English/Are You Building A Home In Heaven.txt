1. Around me many are building,
Homes of beauty and wealth;
But what of a place in heaven,
Where we will live after death.

Chorus:
Are you building a home in heaven,
To live in when this life is o'er;
Will you move to that beautiful city,
And to live with Christ evermore.

2. Long is the road that leads you
To that heavenly home up there;
Is your work on earth completed,
Death may be lingering near.

3. Are you ready for His coming?
Have you been true all along?
Have you finished your building in glory?
Will you move to that heavenly home?
