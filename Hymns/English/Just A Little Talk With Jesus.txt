1. I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in,
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul;
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above,
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole.

Chorus:
(Now let us) Have a little talk with Jesus
(Let us) tell Him all about our troubles
(He will) Hear our faintest cry
(And He will) answer by and by;
(Now when you) Feel a little pray'r wheel turning,
(And you) know a little fire is burning,
(You will) Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right.

2. Sometimes my path seems drear, without a ray of cheer,
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day;
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies,
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way.

3. I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night;
I go to Him in pray'r, He knows my ev'ry care,
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right.
