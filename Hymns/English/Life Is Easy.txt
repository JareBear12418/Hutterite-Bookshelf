1. Life is easy, when you're up on a mountain,
And you've got peace of mind, like you've never known.
But then things change and you're down in a valley;
Don't loose faith, child you are never alone.

Chorus: For the God on the mountain, is still God in the valley.
When things go wrong He'll make them right;
And the God of the good times, is still God in the bad times;
The God of the day, is still God of the night.

2. You talk of faith when you're up on a mountain,
But the talk comes easy when life's at its best;
It's down in the valley, of trials and temptations;
That's when faith is really put to the test.
