1. I owed a debt I could not pay
And it was growing everyday
But Jesus paid it all for me
He gave his life on Calvary
He died for men like you and me
What a pleasure, I love Him, yes I do.

Chorus:
He came a long way from Heaven
To take away our sins and strife
He came a long way from Heaven
To give to us eternal life.

2. They crucified The Holy King
But He was not the one to blame
Oh, father forgive these men He prayed
And to the thief there at His side
He said to him before He died
This day be with me in Paradise.

3. No greater love was ever shown
No greater man was ever known
Than Jesus the lowly Nazarene
Although He never had great fame
There's cleansing fire in His dear name
He's my dear Savior I love him, yes I do.
