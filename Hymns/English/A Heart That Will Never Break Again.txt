1. I remember standing at my daddy's bedside,
As the tears filled up the wrinkles in his face;
As I held his withered hand he smiled and whispered,
'Son, I'm going to live in a better place.'

Chorus:
And I'll have eyes that will never fill with teardrops;
I'll have legs that will never ache with pain;
I'll have hands that will never age or wither,
And a heart that will never break again.

2. I have often heard and read about a city,
Where with Jesus we shall live forever more;
There are mansions in construction for my dwelling,
And the streets of gold will run by my front door.

3. And all the eyes of the blind will then be opened,
And they'll join the victory march of the lame;
And the deaf, who's never heard the roar of thunder,
Will rejoice to hear the Savior call his name.
