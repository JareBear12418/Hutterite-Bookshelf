1. O soul you know the present and the past,
All that you have been through;
Yet lies before the future deep and vast,
God only knows what it will hold for you.

Chorus:
Trust your hand into His
Give your all unto Him;
Let Him lead you all the way,
Trust your hand into His.

2. Maybe some joy or sorrow 'round the bend,
Lies there to wrap your soul;
Or just a chance a helping hand to lend
Some weary wanderer to find the goal.

3. Oh, will you trust your future unto Him,
Who led the men of old;
To lead you too, thro' valleys that are dim
And tread each step as He to you'll unfold.

4. And when at last you're led up the last climb,
And break all earthly ties;
And God himself will welcome you sublime,
Forever more beneath celestial skies.
