1. When heartaches attack me like lions in rage
I haste to find you my weak soul to save
You reach out to touch me and hold me so dear
With hands soft and tender you're drying each tear.

Chorus: My child I hear you, my child I see you
My child I love you, come closer to me
Yes God I feel you, yes God I sense you
Yes God I love you, come closer to me.

2. Then like from nowhere a friends hand, a smile
Giving me courage to make life worthwhile
I thank you dear Savior for giving to me
My friends, but most Lord, I thank you for you.

Yes God I love you, come closer to me
