1. With His hand, oh, He touched me,
With a love like I've never known;
He gave life a brand new meaning,
And to me a reason to go on.

Chorus: He's my bread when I'm hungry;
He's my shelter from troubled winds;
He's my anchor in life's ocean:
But most of all, He's my best friend.

2. When I need hope and inspiration,
He's always strong when I'm tired and weak;
I could search this whole world over,
He'd still be everything that I need.
