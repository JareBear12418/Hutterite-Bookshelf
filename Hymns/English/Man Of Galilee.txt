1. In a manger long ago, I know it was really so,
A babe was born to save a man from sin.
John saw Him on the shore, as the Lamb forevermore.
It was Christ, the Man of Galilee.

Chorus: Oh, I love that Man from Galilee,
He has done so very much for me;
He forgave me all my sins,
Put the love of God within; (next two verses: 'Put the Holy Ghost within')
Oh, I love that Man from Galilee

2. Nicodernus came by night to learn the way of light;
He asked the blessed Lord what he must do;
But the Lord said unto him, 'Ye must be born again;'
By the Spirit of the Man of Galilee.

3. The lame were made to walk, the dumb were made to talk
When words were spoken, with power, in His name.
The blind were made to see and, oh, it could only be.
By the Spirit of the Man of Galilee.
