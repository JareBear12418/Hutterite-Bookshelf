1. When I was but a boy in days of childhood,
I used to play 'til evening shadows come;
Then winding down the old familiar pathway,
I heard my mother call at set of sun.

Chorus:
Come home, come home, it's supper time,
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home, it's supper time,
We're going home at last.

2. One day beside her bedside I was kneeling,
And angel wings were winnowing the air;
She heard the call for supper time in heaven,
And now I know she's waiting for me there.

3. In visions now I see her standing yonder,
And her familiar voice I hear once more;
The banquet table's ready up in heaven
It's supper time upon the golden shore.
