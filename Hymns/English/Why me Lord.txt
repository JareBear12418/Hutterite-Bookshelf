1. Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one, of the pleasures, I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do, that was worth loving you
For the kindness you've shown

Chorus:
Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so help me Jesus
I know what I am
Now that I know that I needed you so help me Jesus
My souls in your hands

2. Try me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay, all I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself on my way back to you.
