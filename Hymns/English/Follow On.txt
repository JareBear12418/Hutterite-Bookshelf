1. Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;
Ev'rywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,
Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.

Chorus:
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
Anywhere, ev'rywhere, I would follow on!
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
Ev'rywhere He leads me I would follow on!

2. Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flows;
With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear,
Danger cannot fright me if my Lord is near.

3. Down in the valley or upon the mountain steep,
Close beside my Savior would my soul ever keep;
He will lead me safely in the path He has trod,
Up to where they gather on the hills of God.
