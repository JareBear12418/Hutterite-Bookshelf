1. There is nothing I can do,
Nothing old or nothing new,
That could earn salvation for my sin sick soul;
But God sees through eyes of grace,
Sees my sins and my mistakes,
And offers me this gift of love to make me whole.

Chorus:
Nothing more could buy my pardon,
Nothing more, that I can do;
Not good deeds that I have done,
Not the honors I have won;
It's not from those, who've gone before,
It's God's grace and nothing more.

2. When my time on earth is past,
And I've reached my home at last,
And I've come into the presence of the Lord;
I will never cease to reign,
Songs of joy and endless praise.
For I've entered by his grace and nothing more.
