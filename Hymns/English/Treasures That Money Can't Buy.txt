1. While driving one day through the quiet countryside
An old man was walking, so I offered a ride
His face was all wrinkled, his hair turned to gray.
And these are the words that he had to say

2. I may look like a beggar, but I'm rich as a king
What I have in my heart gives me reason to sing
I will join there with Jesus, oh' why should I sigh
For these are the treasures that money can't buy

Chorus: Money is worthless when a soul is at stake
If gold bought redemption how much would it take
But He loved me and saved me and I can't explain why
And these are the treasures
these are the treasures that money can't buy

3. So if you look at my garments, and you notice they're torn
But I've a new royal garment that's never been worn
And the cabin I live in is home till I die
But I've a mansion in Glory that money can't buy.
