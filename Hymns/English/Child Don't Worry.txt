1. I am but a lowly human,
Knowing not what life may hold.
How shall I then know the answers
To the questions that unfold?
Puzzling thot's that oft confound me
Seem to take my peace away;
When I try alone to answer
Suddenly the sky seems gray.

Chorus:
Then the Lord in His great mercy,
Seems to touch my troubled brow
Saying, 'Oh my child, don't worry,
I, your God will help you now.'

2. Why is it so hard for me to
Give myself, my all to God?
He will help me if I ask Him,
Where I'm walking He has trod,
So I'll tell Him what I'm thinking,
How I often feel the fear
Of the future that before me
Veiled in mists and shrouds appear.

3. Oh, the answer that He gave me,
How could I so long not see?
I will help my child who humbly
Brings His cares and comes to me.
No, the Lord did never offer
Me the future to foretell,
But He taught me something better:
Come to me and all is well.
