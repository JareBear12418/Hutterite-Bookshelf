1. There's a wonder of sunset at evening,
The wonder of sunrise I see;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is the wonder that God loves me.

Chorus:
Oh the wonder of it all, (The wonder of it all,)
Just to think that God loves me,
Oh the wonder of it all, (Oh the wonder of it all);
Just to think that God loves me.

2. There's the wonder of springtime and harvest,
The sky, the stars, the sun;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is the wonder that's only begun.
