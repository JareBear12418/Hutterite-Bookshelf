1. Once roamed my poor sin sick soul
Christ did every burden roll
Now I walk redeemed and whole
Hand in hand with Jesus

Chorus:
Hand in hand we walk each day
Hand in hand along the way
Walking thus I cannot stray
Hand in hand with Jesus.

2. When the stars are backward rolled
And his home I shall behold
I will walk those streets of gold
Hand in hand with Jesus.
