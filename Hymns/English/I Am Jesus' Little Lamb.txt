1. I am Jesus' little lamb,
Ever glad at heart I am;
Jesus loves me, Jesus knows me;
All things fair and good He shows me,
Even calls me by my name,
Every day He is the same.

2. Safely in and out I go,
Jesus loves and keeps me so;
When I hunger, Jesus feeds me,
When I thirst, my Shepherd leads me
Where the waters softly flow
Where the sweetest pastures grow.

3. Should I not be always glad?
None whom Jesus loves are sad,
And when this short life is ended;
Those whom the good Shepherd tended.
Will be taken to the skies,
There to dwell in Paradise.
