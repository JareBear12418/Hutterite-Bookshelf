I'll have a heart that will never break again

1. I remember standing at my daddy's bedside
And the tears fell off the wrinkles on his face
As I held his withered hand he smiled and whispered,
Son, I'm going to live in a better place.

Chorus: And I'll have eyes that will never fill with teardrops
I'll have a face that will never ache with pain
I'll have hands that will never age and wither
And a heart that will never break again

2. I have often heard and read about a city
Where with Jesus we shall live forevermore
And the mansions in construction for my dwelling
And the streets of gold will run by my front door.
(repeat chorus)

3. And all the eyes of the blind will then be opened
As they join the victory march of the lamb
And the deaf that never heard the roar of thunder
Will rejoice to hear the Savior call their name.
(repeat chorus)
