1. I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

Chorus:
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
Ev'ry hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Savior!
I come to Thee.

2. I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their pow'r
When Thou art nigh.

3. I need Thee ev'ry hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

4. I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfill.

5. I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Most Holy One;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son.
