1. You are my strength when I am weak,
You are the treasure that I seek,
You are my all in all.
Seeking you as a precious jewel,
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool;
You are my all in all.

Chorus:
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name,
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.

2. Taking my sin, my cross, my shame,
Rising again I bless your name;
You are my all in all.
When I fall down, you pick me up;
When I am dry, you fill my cup;
You are my all in all!
