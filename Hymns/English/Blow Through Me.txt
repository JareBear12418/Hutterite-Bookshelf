1. Awake, O north wind, blow thou through me,
Through thee alone am I set free.
Thy judging breeze brings dying in me,
So from the old man am I set free.

2. Awake, O south wind, blow thou through me,
Through thy gentle hand I'm brought to liberty;
Thy warm healing breeze brings life to me,
In thy wind of life I find liberty.

3. Blow thou, O north wind,
Blow thou, O south wind,
Blow thou upon the garden in me,
Till the virtues of Christ flow out from me.
Blow thou upon the garden in me,
Till the virtues of Christ flow out from me.
