1. O dear friends this sinful world is lost and dying,
Every Christian's heart is burdened down with care;
Tell me are you doing all you can for Jesus,
Are you traveling down the Avenue of Prayer?

Chorus:
Keep your faith in your heart consecrated,
Every hour, every day are you prepared?
Are you ready should your Master call at midnight,
Are you traveling down the Avenue of Prayer?

2. Are you praying for the ones who know not Jesus,
As they're being led into the tempter's snare?
Would you stand aside and see a losing battle,
Are you traveling down the Avenue of Prayer?
