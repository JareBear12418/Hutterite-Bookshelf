1. O have you not heard of that beautiful stream
That flows through our Father's land?
Its waters gleam bright in the heavenly light,
And ripple o'er golden sand.

Chorus:
O seek that beautiful stream,
O seek that beautiful stream,
Its waters, so free, are flowing for thee;
O seek that beautiful stream.

2. Its fountains are deep and its waters are pure,
And sweet to the weary soul;
It flows from the throne of Jehovah alone!
O come where its bright waves roll.

3. This beautiful stream is the River of Life!
It flows for all nations free!
A balm for each wound in its water is found;
O sinner, it flows for thee!

4. O will you not drink of this beautiful stream,
And dwell on its peaceful shore?
The Spirit says, Come, all ye weary ones, home,
And wander in sin no more.
