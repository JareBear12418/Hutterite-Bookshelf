1. With shaking knees and my own earnest prayers
We stood before the Lord and all our friends
Your Daddy cried a teardrop as he gave his girl away
And I promised to keep loving you until my dying day

Chorus: What God has joined together let no one come between
Or try to put asunder lovers building their dreams
The light that shines forever is now burning in our hearts
What God has joined together let no one ever part

2. Well that was several years ago today
We walked some rocky roads along the way
But the Lord has helped us make it through
the crazy ups and downs
When we took the wrong road, He turned us both around.

3. When the evening of our lives on earth is near
And our eyes grow weak and words are hard to hear
Well I pray the Lord is tender when He comes to call us home
And He lets us go together, so well never be alone.
