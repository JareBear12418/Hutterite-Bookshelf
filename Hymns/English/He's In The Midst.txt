1. As you travel down life's way He is with you everyday
With every step you take, He's walked ahead of you
And every night as you lay down, angels are camping all around
You'll never be alone, for He is in the midst.

Chorus: He's in the midst of our storm,
He's in the valley we walk through
Where two or three are gathered in His name
He'll be there too
When you feel so all alone, He is standing next to you
He's with us now, our Lord, He's in the midst.

2. Into prison they were thrown Paul and Silas weren't alone
They knew their God was there and
He would see them through
So when the walls began to shake
and their chains just fell away
They cried behold our God for He is in the midst.

He's with us now, our Lord, He's in the midst..
