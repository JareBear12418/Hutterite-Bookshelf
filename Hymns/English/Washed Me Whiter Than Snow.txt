1. Lost and so lonely, just a pilgrim was I
And I had no future, was not ready to die;
But then I met the Savior, Oh, what a friend to know
For He took me to Calvary, washed me whiter than snow.

Chorus:
Saved, yes, I'm saved by His marvelous grace
Now I'm a child of that heavenly place;
Now my heart's filled with gladness, and my life feels all aglow,
For He took me to Calvary, washed me whiter than snow.

2. Now I don't have much money, for this world notices fame
But there's one thing for certain, Jesus knows me by name;
And although I was nothing, now to heaven I will go
For He took me to Calvary, washed me whiter than snow.
