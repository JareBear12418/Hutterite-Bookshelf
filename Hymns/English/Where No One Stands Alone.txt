1. Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low,
In the darkness as black as could be;
And my heart felt alone and I cried, 'O Lord,
Don't hide your face from me.'

Chorus:
Hold my hand all the way,
Ev'ry hour, ev'ryday,
From here to the great unknown.
Take my hand;
Let me stand
Where no one stands alone.

2. Like a king I may live in a palace so tall,
With great riches to call my own;
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone.
