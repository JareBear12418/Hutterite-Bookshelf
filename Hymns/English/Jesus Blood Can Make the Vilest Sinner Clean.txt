1. Come ye sinners lost and hopeless
Jesus blood can make you free
For He saved the worst among you
When He saved a wretch like me.

Chorus:
And I know yes I know
Jesus Blood can make the vilest sinner clean
And I know yes I know
Jesus Blood can make the vilest sinner clean

2. To The faint He giveth power
Through the mountain makes the way
Findeth water in the dessert
Turns the night to golden day.

3. In temptation He is near thee
Holds the power of hell at bay
Guides you to the path of safety
Gives you grace for every day.
