1. What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Chorus:
Lean - ing, lean  - ing,
(Leaning on Jesus, leaning on Jesus,)
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Lean - ing, lean  - ing,
(Leaning on Jesus, leaning on Jesus,)
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

2. Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

3. What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
