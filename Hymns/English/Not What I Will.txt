1. I see through a mirror dimly,
This life of self is wearing thin.
My plans just delay your purpose;
My independence is a sin.

Chorus:
Not what I will,
Not what I desire to be,
But to see your sovereign plan
Perfected in me.

2. How foolish to chart my future;
I see a part, you see the whole.
Restore me, renew perspective,
Be Lord and Master, take control.
