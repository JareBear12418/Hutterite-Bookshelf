1. There is peace and contentment in the Father's house today;
Lots of food on his table and no one is turned away.
There is singing and laughter as the hours pass by,
But a hush calms the singing, as the Father sadly cries:

Chorus:
My house is full but my fields are empty;
Who will go and work for me today?
It seems my children all want to sit around my table,
But no one wants to work in my fields.

2. Push away from the table, look out through the windowpane,
Just beyond the house of plenty lies a field of golden grain,
And it's white unto harvest but the reapers where are they?
In the house; oh, can't the children hear the Father sadly say:

Your house is full but your fields are empty;
We will go and work for you today.
We will not only sit in peace around your table,
But we'll go gather grain in your fields.
