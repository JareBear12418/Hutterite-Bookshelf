1. My Jesus knows when I am lonely,
He knows each pain, He sees each tear;
He understands each lonely heartache,
He understands because He cares.

Chorus:
My Jesus knows just what I need,
Oh, yes, He knows just what I need;
He satisfies, and ev'ry need supplies,
Yes, He knows just what I need.

2. My Jesus knows when I am burdened,
He knows how much my heart can bear;
He lifts me up when I am sinking,
And brings me joy beyond compare.

3. When other friends seem to forget me,
When skies are dark, when hope is gone;
By faith I feel His arms about me,
And hear Him say, 'You're not alone.'
