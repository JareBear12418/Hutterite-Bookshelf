1. As we travel thru' this valley filled with trials great and small,
We're confronted by temptations seeming like the mountains tall,
But with each trouble that comes our way the voice of Jesus seems to say,
'I'll take you thru, I'll be your guide if you'll only keep me by your side.'

Chorus:
So I'll let Him be my light in this dark and sinfilled world,
I'll let Him be my guide, my comfort and my stay,
(I'll let Him be my guide, my comfort and my stay,)
My soul He'll keep when Satan's darts at me are hurled,
And Lord, I trust you'll take my hand and lead me ev'ry day.

2. When your heart is burdened down with care and God seems far away,
You must be the one who changed, my friend for God will ever stay,
But there is hope so don't despair, He'll hear your cry and ev'ry pray'r,
Just pray, 'Dear Lord, I need your love to take me to my home above.'

3. Ever pressing t'ward that home above where joy and love abound,
Where there's happiness and peace of mind and singing all around,
And there forever I will be with the one who gave His life for me,
I'll trust His love within my soul until I reach that heav'nly goal.
