1. This is my desire: to honor you.
Lord, with all my heart I worship you.
With all I have within me, I give you my praise;
All that I adore, is in you, Lord.

Chorus:
Lord, I give you my heart;
I give you my soul;
I live for you alone.
Every breath that I take,
Every moment I'm awake,
Lord, have your way with me.
