Chorus:
Dear Jesus, 'Â¦ light of my life,
You're my Salvation thru trouble and strife;
You've given me hope and strength for each hour
Guiding and leading by Thy holy power.

1. Well, some kind of people don't understand
The gentle assurance of God's healing hand;
He'll bless you and keep you all the day thru
Jesus we love you and you love us, too.

2. Well, someday in glory we'll stand by God's throne
Singing and praising in Heavenly tones;
We'll shout Hallelujah to God be the praise,
We'll have peace in God's valley for the rest of our days.
