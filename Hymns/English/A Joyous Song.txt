1. A joyous song breaks forth among us,
The Lord, the Lord be thanked and praised,
Our song shall reach up to the heavens
A growing branch, a flowery spray;
To us who lay in sin and darkness,
They came a youthful, joy and gladness,
A joyful striving towards the highest,
The Lord, the Lord be thanked and praised.

2. Break forth with all the songs of morning
And may this be in earth and heaven,
Our feet shall always tread earth firmly;
And yet our hands shall reach to heaven;
Arise the way He's there before us,
Arise and give to God the glory,
His mercies shall be flaming torches,
And we ourselves a song of praise.

3. The grace of God once more appearing
Descended to us wretched men,
O Lord, Thy wondrous love came to us
Our love shall rise to Thee again;
Behold us, Lord, who stand before Thee,
Behold and give to us Thy Spirit,
A jubilation rises in us,
Accept the praise we offer Thee.
