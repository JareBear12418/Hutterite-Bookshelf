1. Lord, help me walk another mile,
Just one more mile;
I'm tired of being all alone;
And, Lord, help me smile another smile,
Just one more smile,
I know that I can't make it on my own.

Chorus:
I never thought I needed help before
I thought that I could get by, by myself
But now I know I just can't take it anymore
So with a humble heart, on bended knees
I'm begging you please, 'Lord, help me.'

2. Come down from your golden throne, to me,
To lonely me,
I need to feel the touch of your tender hand;
Remove the days of darkness and let me feel
Or let me see,
Just where I fit into your Master plan.
