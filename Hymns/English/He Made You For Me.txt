From a little acorn, God made a tree;
From a little raindrop, He made the mighty sea.
He gave the honey, to the honey-bee.
And I have a feeling, He made you for me.

He took a grain of dust and He gave human life.
He took one rib from Adam and made him a wife.
He gave the beauty of this world to see.
And I have a feeling, He made you for me.
