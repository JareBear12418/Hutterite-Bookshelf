1. Have you ever taken notice, how people love to tell,
Of the love they have for Jesus,
and He saved their soul from hell,
They claim the holy spirit and wisdom from above,
But how well do they pass this test of love.

Chorus: If you cannot love your brother,
if you cannot love each other,
How can the love of God be in your heart,
Your love to God is not greater,
than you show to your neighbor,
How does your life, pass this test of love.

2. There is only one true pattern, 'tis our Lord Jesus Christ,
Greater love there's never been shown
and yet no greater sacrifice,
Always look for this sign, if love is genuine,
It will never never seek its own.
