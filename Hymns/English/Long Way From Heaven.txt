1. I owed a debt I couldn't pay
And it was growing everyday,
But Jesus paid it all for me;
On the cross of Calvary,
He died for men like you and me,
What Savior, I love Him, yes, I do.

Chorus:
He came a long way from heaven
To take away all sin and strife;
He came a long, long way from heaven
To give to us eternal life.

2. They crucified the Holy King
But He was not the one to blame,
'O Father, forgive these men!' He cried,
And to the thief there at His side,
He said to him before He died,
'This day, be with me in Paradise.'
