1. I want my life to be a light to those around me
I want my life to be that road map that says Home
I want my life to be a beacon on life's raging sea
I want the world to see Jesus when they look at me
Chorus:
And when the world looks at me do they see Jesus?
When the world looks at me what do they see?
Do they see hope, do they see love, do they see charity?
When the world looks at me what do they see?

2. When I spoke did my words contain your wisdom Lord?
And when I prayed did my prayers contain your love?
And did my life reflect the glory of your Spirit?
And did I show the ones around me they were lost?
(repeat chorus)
And when the world looks at you do they see Jesus?

3. When the world looks at you what do they see?
Do they see hope, do they see love, do they see charity?
When the world looks at you what do they see?
Lord when the world looks at me what do they see?
