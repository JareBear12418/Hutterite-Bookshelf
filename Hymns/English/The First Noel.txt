1. The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Chorus:
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

2. And by the light of that same Star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the Star wherever it went.

3. This Star drew nigh to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

4. Then entered in those wise men three,
Full rev'rently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
