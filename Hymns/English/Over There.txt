1. In the Bible we are told,
Of a prophet who was called,
To a city steeped in awful sin;
All the people in that place
Were devoid of saving grace,
And the prophet seemed afraid to enter in.

Chorus:
Over there, over there,
In that land so bright and fair,
He will tell us all about it over there;
On that happy golden strand
We'll take Jonah by the hand,
And he'll tell us all about it over there.

2. Then the prophet forth was sent,
That old Nineveh might repent,
But instead to Tarshish he set sail;
Oh! the wind begin to blow,
Overboard did Jonah go,
And he found a mercy seat inside the whale.

3. In the cold and briny deep,
Tears of grief did Jonah weep,
And the big fish threw him out upon the shore;
Then he gladly went his way,
Preached to Nineveh night and day,
And he did not dare to backslide anymore.

4. Oh, some people don't believe,
That a whale could him receive,
But that doesn't make my song at all untrue;
There are whales on every side,
With their big mouths open wide,
Just take care my friends or one will swallow you.
