1. There are so many roads we must travel
And so many mountains we'll climb
For we pledge our love to each other
Until the end of time.

Chorus: And the song never ends with the singer
The truth outlives a lie
The dream lives on when the dreamer is gone
And true, true love never dies.

2. As I place my ring on your finger
And swear till death do us part
You're the only love in my lifetime
The only song in my heart.

3. I will shine for you like a beacon
A lighthouse on the shore
I will keep you safe in my harbor
Now and forevermore.
