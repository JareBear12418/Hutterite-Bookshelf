1. God is our refuge, our help in time of trouble;
We need not fear the turmoil here below.
Kingdoms fight each other, nations rant and rave in anger;
But when God speaks they lay down every load.

Chorus:
Stand still and know that the Lord he is God.
Though the mountains tremble, let the oceans foam and roar.
The God of Jacob stands beside us; he will not forsake us;
Stand still and know that he is God.

2. There is a river of joy that flows from heaven,
The sacred home of God, the Holy One.
Though the earth may tremble, the home of God is steady,
It stands unmoved by passing sands of time.
