1. Today, I choose to follow you;
Today, I choose to give my 'yes' to you.
Today, I choose to hear your voice and live;
Today, I choose to follow you.

2. As for me and my house, we will serve you.
As for me and my house,
We will spend our lives on you, today.

3. Wonderful Counselor, Everlasting Father,
Eternal King, Lord of Hosts,
Willingly we follow. (repeat 1 & 2)
