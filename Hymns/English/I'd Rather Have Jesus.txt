1. I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
I'd rather be his than have riches untold.
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands;
I'd rather be led by his nail-pierced hands,

Chorus:
Than to be the king of a vast domain,
And be held in sin's dread sway.
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today.

2. I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause;
I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause;
I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame;
I'd rather be true to his holy name,

3. He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;
He's sweeter than honey from out of the comb.
He's all that my hungering spirit needs;
I'd rather have Jesus and let him lead.
