1. I don't need to follow any rainbows
Search the world to find my dream come true
I don't need a lucky star to guide me
I found my treasure in you

2. I don't need to climb another mountain
Set my sail and cross the seven seas
The Paradise that I was always longing for
Was found when you loved me

Chorus:
And now my greatest joy is loving you
The hope I lost was found and made anew
Now my lonely days are finally through
I have found my life in loving you

3. I don't need to pray a prayer unanswered
Make a wish that will never, never come true
For I have found my every answer
My every wish is you.

Dictated to Jesus Christ who made my dreams come true
