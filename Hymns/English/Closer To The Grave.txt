1. Don't you know that Jesus died,
To wash your sins away;
Please heed His call and sin no more,
You're getting closer to the grave each day.

Chorus:
You're getting closer to the grave each day,
Sinner man won't you stop now and pray;
Leave the road to man alone, let Jesus lead you home,
You're getting closer to the grave each day.

2. They nailed His hands there on the cross,
On His head the thorns they laid,
Be prepared to go that's one thing I know,
You're getting closer to the grave each day.

3. On the great Judgment day when the life's book is read,
There'll be no more time to pray;
Learn to love and forgive for on earth to live,
You're getting closer to the grave each day.
