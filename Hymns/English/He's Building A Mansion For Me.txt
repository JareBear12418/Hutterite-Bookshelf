1. The words of the Master so long, long ago,
He promised a city with streets of pure gold,
He's building a mansion for me.
And someday that beautiful place I will see,
For he brought salvation upon Calvary,
He's building a mansion for me.

Chorus:
Somewhere in that land far over the sea,
He's building a mansion for me,
I long for the day, when my Savior I'll see;
When I get to heaven, so happy I'll be,
He's building a mansion for me.

2. What peace, joy and happiness we often share,
In mansions of splendor and beauty so rare,
He's building a mansion for me.
For if we will serve Him in this world below,
A beautiful mansion is waiting I know,
He's building a mansion for me.
