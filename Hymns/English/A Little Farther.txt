1. Just before His trial, Jesus entered dark Gethsemane;
Leaving eight outside, took Peter and two sons of Zebedee.
Oh, the anguish in the garden, as again He left the three;
And He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary!

Refrain:
Let us go a little farther, farther than we've gone before;
Are we workers now for Jesus? Let us do a little more.

2. See Him praying, hear him groaning; death sweeps o'er Him like a flood;
'Let this cup pass from me, Father'' sweat runs down as drops of blood!
'Not my will, Lord, I will drink it: let Thy will be done in me.'
And He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary!

3. Then at Pilate's hall, behold Him, as the mob who mocked him cried,
'Away, away, give us Barabbas; let this Christ be crucified!'
Oh, Barabbas, oh, Barabbas, Jesus surely died for thee,
When He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary!

4. Now He marches to Golgotha, scourged and thorn-crowned on the road;
Bears the cross upon His shoulder, sinks beneath the heavy load!
Mocked, reviled, by friends forsaken' all for you, and all for me'
And He went a little farther, all the way to Calvary!
