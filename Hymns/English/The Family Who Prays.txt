1. Satan has parted fathers and mothers
Leaving their children with sad aching hearts
Leading their pathways down to destruction
But the family who prays never shall part

Chorus:
The family who prays shall never be parted
Its circle in Heaven unbroken shall stand
God will say enter my dear faithful servant
But the family who prays never shall part

2. Wars and tornados are taken our loved ones
Leaving their children as orphans to stay
But we shall meet them over the river
And the family who prays never shall part.
