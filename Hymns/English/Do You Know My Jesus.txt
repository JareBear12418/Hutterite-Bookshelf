1. Have you a heart that's weary,
Tending a load of care?
Are you a soul that's seeking
Rest from the burden you bear?

Chorus:
Do you know (Do you know) my Jesus?
Do you know (Do you know) my friend?
Have you heard (Have you heard) He loves you,
And that He will abide till the end? (till the end?)

2. Where is your heart, O pilgrim?
What does your light reveal?
Who hears your call for comfort
When naught but sorrow you feel?

3. Who knows your disappointments?
Who hears each time you cry?
Who understands your heartaches?
Who dries the tears from your eyes?
