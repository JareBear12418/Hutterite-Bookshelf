1. The pain in my bones bring tears to my eyes,
Oh, Lord, I have suffered, many times I have cried;
In this wheelchair I'll wait, for the day I'll be free
There's a place up in heaven, please share it with me.

Chorus:
Take me up in your heaven, I can't seem to bear,
My body's all crumbled in this old wheelchair;
Nobody loves me, no reason I see,
Why you up in heaven, keep your door closed on me.

2. I'm not asking for favors, but I'd sure like to know,
Why I have deserved this suffering so;
Take the pain from within me but just for tonight,
And replace it tomorrow with your heavenly light.
