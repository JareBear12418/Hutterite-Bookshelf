1. I prayed to know more joy in my salvation,
A selfish prayer I finally came to know.
For my greatest joy in living, comes to me when I am giving-
Giving children bread of life and watch them grow.

Chorus: And my greatest joy is knowing
that my children walk in truth,
And that they are giving you, Lord,
of their fire and strength of youth.
Yes, I found the greatest joy in my Salvation-
Is knowing that my children walk in truth.

2. It's hard to feed someone else when you're hungry;
You can't teach if you don't understand.
And no one will follow you, if you don't live it each day through;
A frightened child won't hold a trembling hand.
