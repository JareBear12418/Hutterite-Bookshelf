1. He made the lame to walk, He caused the blind to see,
He made the dumb to talk, He set the captive free;
He is the same today as yesterday,
He'll do the same for you, He is the same today.

Chorus:
Jesus, blessed Jesus
He never faileth, His word is true,
He'll hear your heart's cry, He'll answer you,
He is just the same today.

2. He heard Bartimaeus, He heard the lepers cry,
On road Emmaus, He did draw nigh;
He lifted burdens and all their cares
He'll do the same for you, He is the same today.

3. Beside blue Galilee, He fed the multitude,
Rebuked the Pharisees and taught beatitude;
In loving kindness, unto all men
He'll do the same for you, He is the same today.
