1. O what glory awaits me in heaven's bright city,
When I get there such sights I'll behold;
A million scenes of rare beauty will be there I'll view them
Still Jesus will outshine them all.

Chorus:
Mansions will glisten on the hills of glory,
Happy reunion on streets of gold;
Angel choir singing glad praises forever
But Jesus will outshine them all.

2. The sparkling river is flowing, happy faces are glowing,
Land of splendor where night never falls;
The golden glass gives reflection to that city's perfection
Still Jesus will outshine them all.
