1. Great is the work of God's hand divine,
He made the moon and stars to shine.
Beautiful flowers with fragrance rare,
These are the works of the almighty God.

Chorus: Mountains so great, a sky so blue,
God's bright light to shine upon you.
The fathomless depth of the mighty --- sea
(mighty rolling sea)
Oh, the wonders of Godnever cease.
(an almighty God never cease).

2. Small rippling streams flowing by the way,
The birds in the trees with colors gay.
Silvery moon shining, oh, so bright,
These are the works of the almighty God.

3. A lovely day, when the sun shines bright,
The showers of rain on summer night.
Beautiful rainbow across the sky,
These are the works of the almighty God.

4. True to this God we must ever be,
And watch and pray continually.
Grow in His grace, faith and courage strong,
Then we will meet Him, the almighty God.
