I met a girl out in the hill, she gave my lonely heart a thrill.
Her beauty seemed just like a breath of spring.
And when I looked into her eyes, I thought of bluest summer skies,
And when I held her hand in mine, I heard the bluebird sing:

They sang of wondering. (Wondering if he loves her.)
Will she marry? ( Marry if he'll ask her.)
Will her heart be (Heart be true for him for) then and ever more?
And when she's lonely (Lonely is he near her.)
When there's sadness (Sadness will he cheer her.)
Will they always (Always be together) until in death they part?

I courted her for months on end until she promised we would wed.
We planned on being married in the spring.
All through the long cold winter months
It seemed that spring would never come,
And every gloomy winter day, I heard the bluebird sing:

They sang of waiting. (Waiting for the flowers.)
And of counting. (Counting every hour.)
Till the bluebird (Bluebird chirps its welcome)
Into the world once more.
And while we're waiting (waiting for the sunshine)
We keep hating (Hating every storm cloud)
That has gathered (Gathered o'er the mountain) to keep us far apart.

Then when at last spring touched the earth,
We were married in a village church.
Our wedding seemed just like a dream come true.
Though many years have come and gone,
Our love is still as true and strong
As when I found her long ago, and still the bluebird sings:

They sang of loving, (Loving every hour,)
That I'm married. (Married to my flower.)
And we're happy (Happy ever after)
As since the day we met.
And though we're older, (Older love is sweeter)
We grow fonder, (Fonder of each other)
Will be sweethearts (Sweethearts close together) until the end of time.
