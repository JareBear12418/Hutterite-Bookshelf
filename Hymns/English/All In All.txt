1. I've been traveling this road for a long time,
And yet I walk very slow.
The mountains sure have been hard to climb,
Sometimes I have to carry a heavy load.

Chorus: But all in all, it will be worth it all when I get home
When I top that last mountain,
And lay down my heavy load;
Tears of joy will fill my eyes,
And I'Â­ll just sit right down and cry,
For all in all, it will be worth it all when I get home.

2. Why sure there have been a lot of trials,
But God said they were just to make me strong.
And though the night is dark and lonely,
I know that He will never leave me alone.
