1. Shall we gather at the river,
Where bright angel feet have trod;
With its crystal tide forever
Flowing from the throne of God?

Chorus:
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river,
Gather with the saints at the river,
That flows from the throne of God.

2. On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray;
We shall walk and worship ever
All the happy golden day.

3. Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we ev'ry burden down,
Grace our spirits will deliver
And provide a robe and crown.

4. Soon we'll reach the shining river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace.
