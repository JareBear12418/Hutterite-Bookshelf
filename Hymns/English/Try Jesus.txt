1. You have tried the path of worldly pleasure,
Sought for peace, the world can never give;
O be careful where you place your treasure,
You need One to teach you how to live.

Chorus:
Try Jesus, He never fails,
(never fails,)
O'er evil His love prevails,
(for evermore prevails,)
In sunshine or stormy gales,
(in the stormy gales,)
Try Jesus, He never fails.
(never, never fails.)

2. Oft your day begins with seeming gladness,
Hope is high, your heart with joy is light;
Shadows fall and darkness brings you sadness
You need One to banish fears of night.

3. As you walk alone in silence, thinking,
How you met with failures on the way;
Ere your soul in deep despair is sinking,
You need One whom winds and waves obey.

4. Time is short, the moments swiftly flying,
Money can not buy sweet peace within;
You are longing, seeking groping, sighing,
You need One to cleanse you from your sin.
