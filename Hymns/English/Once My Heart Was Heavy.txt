1. Once my heart was heavy,
I was living in sin;
But when I found Jesus,
And He took me in.

Chorus:
And He saved me, saved me,
And from sin set me free;
Yes, He saved me, cause He loved me,
Yes, Jesus saved me.

2. Once I thought I'd never,
Find peace of mind;
But I gave my heart to Jesus,
And He saved this soul of mine.

3. So if your heart is burdened,
I'll tell you what to do;
Just put your trust in Jesus,
And He'll save you, too.
