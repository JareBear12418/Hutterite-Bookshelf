1. There is no name so sweet on earth,
No name so dear in heaven,
As that before His wondrous birth
To Christ the Savior given.

Chorus:
We love to sing around our King,
And hail Him blessed Jesus;
For there's no word ear ever heard
So dear, so sweet as Jesus.

2. 'Twas Gabriel first that did proclaim,
To His most blessed mother,
That name which now and evermore
We praise above all other.

3. And when He hung upon the tree,
They wrote His name above Him,
That all might see the reason we
Forevermore must love Him.

4. So now upon His Father's throne,
Almighty to relieve us
From sin and pains, He ever reigns
The Prince and Savior, Jesus.
