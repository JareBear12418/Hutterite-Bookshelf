1. Take the Name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you
Take it then, where'er you go.

Chorus:
Precious name, O how sweet!
(Precious name, how sweet!)
Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;
Precious name, O how sweet!
(Precious name, how sweet!)
Hope of earth and joy of heav'n.

2. Take the name of Jesus ever
As a shield from ev'ry snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

3. O the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us
And His songs our tongues employ!

4. At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostate at His feet,
King of kings in heav'n we'll crown Him
When our journey is complete.
