1. You cannot hide, the shining light of a city on a hill,
Nor the candlelight, that's shining bright upon a windowsill,
So just as well you too can tell by the life of ev'ryone,
If love's inside it'll show outside by the deeds that they have done.

Chorus:
How can you help but shine your light, after the Lord has saved your life?
How can you show a trace of doubt after your sin has been cast out,
Down in the deepest of the sea and even from God's memory?
So lift your voice in a happy song as thru this life you pass along.

2. If you recall, apostle Paul was struck down to the ground,
He heard the voice, he made the choice to turn his life around,
There was no doubt the word was out that he had changed his ways,
He boldly claimed the worthy name of Jesus ev'ry day.

3. So how could we, who've been set free, refuse to do the same,
In all we do, bring glory to, the Savior's worthy name,
For if we fail, who will prevail, and be the shining light,
And show the lost, the awful cost, of wand'ring in the night.
