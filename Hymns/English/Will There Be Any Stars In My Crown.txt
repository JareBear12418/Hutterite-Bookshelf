1. I am thinking today of that beautiful land,
I shall reach when the sun goeth down.
By the wonderful grace of my Savior I stand,
Will there be any stars in my crown?

Chorus: Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown,
When at evening the sun goeth down.
Will I wait with the blessed in the mansions of rest?
Will there be any stars in my crown?

2. In the strength of the Lord, let me labor and praise,
Let me watch as a winner of souls.
That the stars may be mine, in the glorious days,
When His praise like the sea billows roll.
