1. I want to be a soul winner for Jesus ev'ry day,
He does so much for me;
I want to aid the lost sinner to leave his erring way,
And be from bondage free.

Chorus:
A soul winner for Je - sus,
(A soul winner for Jesus Christ the Lord)
A soul winner for Je - sus,
(A soul winner for Jesus Christ the Lord)
O let me be each day;
A soul winner for Je - sus,
(A soul winner for Jesus Christ the Lord)
A soul winner for Je - sus,
(A soul winner for Jesus Christ the Lord)
He's done so much for me.

2. I want to be a soul winner and bring the lost to Christ,
That they His grace may know;
I want to live for Christ ever, and do His blessed will,
Because He loves me so.

3. I want to be a soul winner till Jesus calls for me,
To lay my burdens down;
I want to hear Him say, servant, 'You've gathered many sheaves,
Receive a starry crown.'
