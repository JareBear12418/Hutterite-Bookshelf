1. If anyone is thirsty - Let them come to me and drink,
I will satisfy the dryness of their soul.
Once believing, streams of water
Will erupt from deep within,
Causing love and joy and peace to overflow.

Chorus:
Like a fountain, overflowing:
Do a cleansing; Holy Spirit, take control.
Living Water, melt the hardness,
Flow within me; be a river to my soul.
