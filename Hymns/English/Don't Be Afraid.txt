1. Don't be afraid, I am with you,
With you wherever you go.
This Jesus told his disciples;
The sweetest words I know.

Chorus:
Oh' , Don't be afraid I am with you,
Near you forever I'll be,
Oh' , Don't fear the waves for it's Jesus
Walking upon life's sea.

2. Behold the wounds and the nail prints;
What does it all mean to thee?
No greater love has been proven,
Come now, believe in me.

3. With him you'll never be lonely,
Constant companion he'll be,
The dearest friend may forsake you,
Faithful he'll see you thro'.

Chorus:
Oh' , Don't be afraid he is with you,
Near you forever he'll be,
Oh' , Don't fear the waves for it's Jesus
Walking upon life's sea.
