1. I have heard of Christians long ago
Were brought before a tyrant's throne
They were told that he would spare their lives
If they would renounce the name of Christ
And one by one they chose to die
The Son of God they would not deny
Like a great angelic choir sing
I can almost hear their voices ring

Chorus:
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
With all my strength with all I am
I will seek to honor His command
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

2. Now the years have come and the years have gone
And the cause of Jesus still goes on
Now the time has come to count the cost
To reject this world to embrace the cross
And one by one let's live our lives
For the one who died to give us life
the trumpet sounds on that final day
Let us proudly stand and boldly say

(repeat chorus)
To the Lamb of God who bore my pain
Who took my place and wore my shame
I will seek to honor His command
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
