1. There was no crown for Him of silver nor of gold
There was no diadem for Him to hold;
But blood adorned His brow and proud its stain He bore
And sinners gave to Him the crown He wore.

Chorus:
A rugged cross became His Throne.
(Yes, a rugged cross)
His Kingdom was In hearts alone.
(His Kingdom was in hearts alone)
He wrote His love in crimson red
(Yes, He wrote His love)
And He wore the thorns upon His head.
(Yes, He wore the thorns)

2. He did not reign upon the throne of ivory
But died upon the cross of Calvary;
For sinners there He counted all He owned but loss
And He surveyed His Kingdom from a cross.

3. No purple robe He wore His bleeding wounds to hide,
But stripes upon His back He wore with pride;
And from the wounds there flowed a crimson, cleansing stream,
That was a cover for the soul unclean.
