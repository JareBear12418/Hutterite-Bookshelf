1. When my final sun goes down behind those lonely hills of time,
And my last day is ending here below;
When the river dark I see, I won't have to cross alone,
For someone will be waiting (there) I know.

Chorus:
Someone will be waiting to take me by the hand,
Someone who knows the way, who cares and understands;
That dark and lonely valley will hold no fear for me,
For someone will be waiting I know.

2. There will come a time I know when all my friends who walked with me
Cannot pass where my soul at last must go;
But I'll never walk alone, I have a friend who knows the way,
And thru the night He'll lead me (on) I know.
