Would we truly long for heaven

If this life was perfect here

If we had no pain or heartache

If we never shed a tear



If we had no disappointments

And our dreams would all come true

Could we keep that heavenly vision?

And that deep enteral view



Would we truly long for heaven

At the ending of the road

If our backs were never breaking

From the burden of the load



If the sun was always shining

If we never felt the gale

Would we long for heavens harbor?

To be safe within the vale



Yes, dear Savior we are longing

To be safe on heaven's shore

And these trials only make us

Long for heaven more and more



And we see that you are using

Every trial of each day

As a tug from heaven's harbor

Just to pull us heaven's way
