1. May the Lord be your shepherd ev'ry hour and day,
As together you follow Him along life's way,
May He feed your soul beside the waters still,
Cause your love to grow stronger as He surely will.

Chorus:
Many waters cannot quench love,
If you're led by the Heavenly Dove;
Though the storms rage around you and the waves are tossing high,
Or by cool peaceful waters under bright cloudless sky,
You can be assured that with Jesus nigh,
Many waters cannot quench love!

2. But should storm winds blow and when the rain descends,
With your love on the rock and not on shifting sand,
You need never fear what any storm can do;
Grasp the hand of the Master and He'll hold yours too.

3. You may shed some tears of sorrow or distress,
But you'll also have tears of joy and happiness,
Though the fortunes of this life may smile or frown;
Just remember that Christ will never let you down.
