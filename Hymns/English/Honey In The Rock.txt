1. O my brother, do you know the Savior,
Who is wondrous kind and true?
He's the 'Rock of your salvation!'
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

Chorus:
Oh, there's Honey in the Rock, my brother, (my brother)
There's Honey in the Rock for you; (for you;)
Leave your sins for the blood to cover,
There's Honey in the Rock for you. (for you)

2. Have you 'tasted that the Lord is gracious?'
Do you walk in the way that's new?
Have you drunk from the living fountain?
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

3. Do you pray unto God the Father,
'What wilt Thou have me to do?'
Never fear, He will surely answer,
There's Honey in the Rock for you.

4. Then go out thro' the streets and byways
Preach the word to the many or few;
Say to ev'ry fallen brother,
There's Honey in the Rock for you.
