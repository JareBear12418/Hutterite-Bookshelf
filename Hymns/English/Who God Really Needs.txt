1. There are people in our churches,
Who say they love the Lord.
They come to church on Sunday,
And read His Holy Word.
They think they're the one important,
For the sinners they do plead.
Let's just stop to think about it,
Who God really needs.

2. God needs men to be like Joseph,
Not giving in to sin.
Standing for the truth each day,
And keeping pure within.
Or to have a faith like Abraham,
Leaving friends and home.
Following where Jesus calls,
Though it may be alone.

Chorus: So let us take a stand for honesty,
Speaking words of love.
Never compromising truth,
For our Lord above.
Jesus wants us to be faithful,
And claim the victory.
Let's just stop to think about it,
Who God really needs.

3. God needs men to be like Moses,
Walking with the Lord.
Or to be a man like David,
After God's own heart.
But the thing that makes the difference,
By the man that they call Jesus,
Is to ask Him to come closer,
And let Him be your Lord.

4. God needs women to be like Sarah,
Submitting to her Lord,
Walking in humility
And trusting in God's Word.
Or to be someone like Mary,
Who accepting all in faith,
Hiding deep within her heart
What she didn't understand.
