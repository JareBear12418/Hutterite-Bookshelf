Chorus:
Come, now is the time to worship;
Come, now is the time to give your heart;
Come, just as you are to worship;
Come, just as you are before your God.

1. One day every tongue will confess you are God;
One day every knee will bow;
Still, the greatest treasure remains for those
Who gladly choose you now.
