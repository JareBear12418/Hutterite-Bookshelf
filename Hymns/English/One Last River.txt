1. Thru the valleys, o'er the rivers, troubled waters we will cross,
As we travel on to Canaan's promised land.
Self denying, we'll keep trying, in the name of Christ we'll win.
On the banks of Jordan someday we will stand.

Chorus:
Raging waters, one last river,
(Waters, raging waters,) (River, one last river,)
As the sun is sinking fast. (Is sinking fast)
Over Jordan,
(Looking over Jordan,)
Jesus waits there,
(Waits with loving welcome,)
Safe forever,
(Ever, safe forever,)
Home at last! (Home at last!)

2. What a comfort, what a pleasure to be one with God in Christ,
As we face the evil forces all around.
Oh, what power ev'ry hour as we overcome the foe,
As we march along so happy, heavenbound.

3. Jesus, tender shepherd, lead us to that far off promised land,
As we suffer with the Christ of Calvary,
Kindly leading, now entreating, 'Little children, follow me.'
Just across the river, life eternally.
