1. I have a Savior, he's pleading in glory,
A dear, loving Savior, tho' earth friends be few;
And now he is watching in tenderness o'er me,
But oh, that my Savior were your Savior too!

Chorus:
For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
I'm praying for you.

2. I have a Father; to me he has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
And soon will he call me to meet him in heaven,
But oh, that he'd let me bring you with me too!

3. I have a robe; 'tis resplendent in whiteness,
Awaiting in glory my wondering view;
Oh, when I receive it all shining in brightness,
Dear friend, could I see you receiving one too!

4. When he has found you, tell others the story,
That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;
Then pray that your Savior may bring them to glory,
And prayer will be answered -- 'twas answered for you!
