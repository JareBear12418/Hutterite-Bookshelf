1. From the manger where He layed,
To the garden where He prayed,
I'd often heard about this stranger;
Then I opened up my heart,
And He walked into my life,
Now we're not strangers anymore.

Chorus:
For He's my friend, He's my Lord,
Oh how I love Him, He's my Father,
Now we'll walk hand in hand,
For we're not strangers anymore.

2. I had heard about this man,
Who could even wake the dead,
I heard He calmed the trouble waters;
But I never knew for me,
He would calm the raging sea,
But all I do is call His name.

3. If you're looking for a friend,
Who'll go with you till the end,
Someone who's closer than a brother;
Why not give this man a try,
For even now He's passing by,
You won't be strangers anymore.
