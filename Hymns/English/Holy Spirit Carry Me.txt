1. Holy Spirit, carry me
To higher plains of liberty;
I want to be so close to thee,
That through my life the world can see.
Help me when I'm feeling low,
When burdens seem so hard to bear;
Lift me up, don't let me go,
It's so good to know you're there.

Chorus: Holy Spirit, lead me on,
Give me strength when things go wrong.
I won't ask for much at all,
Just pick me up when I fall.

2. What have I to fear or dread,
If by His Spirit I am led.
I'll try not to plan ahead,
I'll wait for leadership instead.
Like the potter and the clay,
Form my life to fit your plan,
Give me joy each passing day,
And help me love my fellowman.
