1. Twas a day in early springtime,
By an ancient wayside well,
Eleazar paused to rest his camel train;
He had found a bride for Isaac,
As the evening shadows fell,
For the weary journey had not been in vain.

Chorus:
O get ready evening shadows fall,
Don't you hear the Eleazar call,
There's going to be a wedding, our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train comes in.

2. Now he took the fair Rebecca,
Draped in jewels rich and rare,
Back to Abraham and Isaac far away;
Where Rebecca loved her Isaac
And he loved Rebecca fair,
O that must have been a happy Wedding Day.

3. Now the blessed holy Spirit,
Left the Father God above,
To come down to earth to find the worthy bride;
For our Isaac over yonder
Has prepared his tents of love,
And he wants his fair Rebecca by his side.

4. We have left our kinfolk gladly,
We have bid this world good-bye,
We are going to that land beyond the sky;
There we'll behold our Isaac
In that blest eternity,
What a happy, happy Wedding that will be.
