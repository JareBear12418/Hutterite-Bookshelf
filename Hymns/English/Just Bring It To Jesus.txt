1. Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?
Have you ever been discouraged
By a problem or two?

Chorus:
Just bring it to Jesus;
He'll show you the way,
From the midst of your sorrows,
Into glorious days.

2. Are you very disappointed?
If a friend isn't true,
Are you grieved in the spirit,
Of how this world's treating you?
