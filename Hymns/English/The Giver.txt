1. When you meet someone who is down,
And their heart has been broken by everyone around;
Take the time to make their day worthwhile,
Give them all you can; all they may need is a smile.

Chorus: Happy is the giver who's generously giving,
Giving with joy, giving with love,
Giving till he thought there was nothing left to give;
Taking what the Lord was giving to him,
Starting all over to do it again,
Learning to live by giving all you can give.

2. Once a babe was born in Bethlehem;
He was given to save the world from all its shame and sin;
What a sacrifice to God it must have been.
So give Him all you can, 'cause you'll never out give Him.
