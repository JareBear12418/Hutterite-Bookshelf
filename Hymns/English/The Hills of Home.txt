1. The holy hills of heaven called me,
To mansions bright across the sea;
Where loved ones wait and crowns are given
The hills of home keep calling me.

Chorus:
This house of flesh is but a prison
Bars upon, hold my soul,
But the doors of clay are gonna burst wide open;
When the angels sets my spirit free,
I'll take my flight like the mighty eagle
When the hills of home start calling me.

2. I'll see loved ones over yonder,
Tears are gone and hearts are free;
And from the throne my Savior beckons
And the hills of home keep calling me.
