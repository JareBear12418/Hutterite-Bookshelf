1. Come and go with me to my Father's house,
To my Father's house, to my Father's house,
Come and go with me to my Father's house,
There is peace, peace, peace, (3.)
Come and go with me to my Father house,
There is peace, peace, peace.

2. There's eternal joy in my Father's house,
In my Father's house, in my Father's house
There's eternal joy in my Father's house,
There is joy, joy, joy, (3.)
There's eternal joy in my Father's house,
There is joy, joy, joy.

3. Hearts together swing, hands join in a ring,
Praises to Him sing, praises to Him sing,
Hearts together swing, hands join in a ring,
There is love, love, love, (3.)
Hearts together swing, hands join in a ring,
There is love, love, love.
