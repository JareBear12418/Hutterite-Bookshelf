1. Oh, your life is a canvas on which to portray
A picture of Christ and His Word.
He provides the instructions and colors to use,
To paint Christ, a light to the world.

Chorus: You are painting a picture of Christ with your life;
Does your picture His beauty portray?
Can the world in its darkness see Jesus shine thru,
In the picture you paint ev'ry day?

2. Do the colors shine true in the light of His Word?
Are you painting with thought and with prayer?
A picture of beauty and light to behold,
In its beauty to shine ev'rywhere.

3. Does the picture at times not appear to be true?
Is His figure distorted somewhere?
Do the colors seem dull and the beauty all gone?
With the world a false picture you share.
