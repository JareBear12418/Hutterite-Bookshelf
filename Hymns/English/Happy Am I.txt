1. Happy am I! Jesus is mine forever,
Never to leave always in each endeavor;
Leading me on in a life ending never,
Giving a smile, every mile, happy am I.

2. Happy am I! All my sins forgivin',
What a great day life is now worth the livin';
One of these days I'll be enjoying heaven,
Now that I know, upward I'll go, happy am I.

3. Happy am I! How can I help but shout it,
Everyday, telling the world about it;
Jesus is real only believe, don't doubt it,
Then you can be, happy like me, happy am I.
