The postman knocked and waited for a sweet face to appear.
A face that showed her heart was full of joy.
In the cottage doorway, smiling through her tears.
Each time she got a letter from her boy.

Her pale hands were trembling, the postman noticed too
That her sweet and anxious face was white.
Would this be the letter that she was waiting for?
And would it tell her that he was alright?

I'm sorry said the postman, I must ask you to sign
This little book that I have brought along.
You see this letter's registered, he slowly bowed his head.
And then she knew that there was something wrong.

The address on the corner of the envelope of blue,
Told her that her darling son was dead.
Where Jimmy's name and number had always been before
The captain's name was written there instead.

Dear God, they've made my darling's grave; I know God has his soul.
She prayed a humble prayer to God each night.
Placed on his grave a blooming rose for all the world to see.
Her soldier boy had won his robe of white.
