1. There's a crown in heaven for the striving soul,
Which the blessed Jesus Himself will place;
On the head of each, who shall faithful prove,
Even unto death in that heavenly rest.

Chorus:
Oh may that crown, (Oh may that crown)
In heaven be mine, (In heaven be mine,)
And I among (And I among)
The angels shine; (The angels shine;)
Be thou oh, Lord, (Be thou oh, Lord,)
My daily guide, (My daily guide,)
Let me ever in Thy love abide.

2. There's a rest in heaven for the weary soul,
It's for all by care and by sin oppressed
To the Sons of God it remaineth sure;
And the prophet says, 'It's a glorious rest.'

Chorus:
Oh may that rest, (Oh may the rest,)

3. There's a home in heaven for the faithful soul,
In the many mansions prepared of old;
Where the glorified shall forever sing,
Of the Savior's free and abounded love.

Chorus:
Oh may that home, (Oh may that home,)
