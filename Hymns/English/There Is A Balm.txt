1. Sometimes I feel discouraged,
And think my work's in vain,
But then the Holy Spirit
Revives my soul again,

Chorus:
There is a balm in Gilead
To make the wounded whole,
There is a balm in Gilead
To heal the sinsick soul.

2. Don't ever feel discouraged,
Our Father is our friend;
And if you look for knowledge,
He'll not refuse to lend.

3. If you cannot preach like Peter,
If you cannot pray like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus,
And say, 'He died for all!'
