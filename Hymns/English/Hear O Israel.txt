1. Hear, O Israel, the Lord, thy God, is one Lord.
Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all of thy heart;
Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all of thy soul;
Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all of thy mind;
Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all of thy strength.

2. Hear, O Israel, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all of thy heart;
Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all of thy soul;
Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all of thy mind;
Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all of thy strength.
