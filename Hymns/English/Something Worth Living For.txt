1. Life was shattered and hope was gone
Crushing the load that I bore;
Then out of the depths I cried,
'O God, Give me something worth living for.'

Chorus:
Something more than my yesterdays,
More than I had before,
Something more than wealth or fame
He gave me something worth living for.

2. There, with life at its lowest ebb,
Who could heal and restore?
Then He came and mended my broken heart
He gave me something worth living for.

3. O the joy of sins forgiv'n
Nothing's the same as before;
My life overflows since Jesus came
And gave me something worth living for.
