1. Where can I go, when there's no one else to turn to?
Whom can I talk to, when nobody wants to listen?
Whom do I lean on, when there's no foundation stable?
I go to the rock, I know that's stable, I go to the rock.

Chorus:
I go to the rock of my Salvation
Go to the stone that the builders rejected,
Run to the mountain, and the mountain stands by me;
The earth all around me is sinking sand,
On Christ the solid rock I stand,
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock.

2. Where can I hide till the storms have all passed over.
Where can I run when the wind of sorrow threatens?
Is there a refuge in time of great tribulation?
When my soul needs consolation, I go to the rock.
