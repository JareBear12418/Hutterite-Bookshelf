1. Worthy art thou, Lord, divine
To receive the praise of mine,
To receive this grateful praise of mine;
Mercy hast thou shown to me,
And my soul delights in thee,
Joyfully my soul delights in thee.

Chorus:
Lord, I thank thee for thy love,
Draw my heart to thine above;
True and faithful would I be,
Jesus, draw me close to Thee.

2. From the dawn of my first day,
Thou hast led me all the way,
Guided, loved, and kept me all the way;
And Thy life blood Thou didst give,
That forever I may live,
That with Thee forever I may live.

3. All my guilt thou dost remove,
In Thy great redeeming love,
Thru Thy great redeeming grace and love;
And this love so full and free,
Gives me joy to come to Thee,
Boldly, gladly, do I come to Thee.
