1. Soft as the voice of an angel, Breathing a lesson unheard,
Hope with a gentle persuasion, Whispers her comforting words;
Wait till the darkness is over, Wait till the tempest is done,
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow, After the shower is gone.

Chorus:
Whispering hope,
(Whispering hope, Whispering hope,)
Oh, how welcome thy voice,
(Welcome thy voice, oh, how welcome thy voice,)
Making my heart,
(Making my heart, making my heart,)
In its sorrow rejoice.
(In its sorrow rejoice, its sorrow rejoice.)

2. If in the dusk of the twilight, Dim be the region afar,
Will not the deepening darkness, Brighten the glimmering stars?
Then when the night is upon us, Why should my heart sink away?
When the dark midnight is over, Watch for the breaking of day.

3. Hope, as an anchor so steadfast, Rends the dark veil for the soul,
Whither the Master has entered, Robbing the grave of its goal;
Come then, O come, glad fruition, Come to my sad, weary heart;
Come, O thou blest hope of glory, Never, O never depart.
