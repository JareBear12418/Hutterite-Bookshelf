1. Mother said when she was dying,
Just before her breath was gone;
'Put your holy trust in Jesus
Or you will be left alone.'

Chorus:
You've got to walk that lonesome valley,
You've to go there by yourself,
There's no one here to go there with you,
You've got to go there by yourself.

2. Some folks say He's John the Baptist,
Others say He is a Jew,
But the Bible plainly tells us,
That He is a preacher, too.

3. I wish I could sing like a holy angel,
Or could preach like Apostle Paul;
Jesus Christ our mighty Savior
Died for sins to save us all.
