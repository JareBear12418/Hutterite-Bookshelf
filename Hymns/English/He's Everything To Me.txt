1. I can never quite explain,
How the blessed Savior came,
Came and took my sins away;
I only know He came to me,
Came one day and set me free,
Dwelt within my heart to stay.

Chorus:
Now He is ev'rything to me, and He will always be
(Ev - 'ry - thing to me, He will always be,)
All I'll ever need,
His love will satisfy 'til the day I die,
(Love will satisfy 'til the day I die,)
And through eternity;
Until at last with Him I stand in the heav'nly land,
('Til with Him I stand in the heav'nly land,)
He will walk with me,
He's living in my heart, never to depart,
(Liv - ing in my heart, ne - ver to depart,)
He's everything to me.

2. When the sun of life grows dim,
I will still belong to Him,
He will still be all to me;
Far beyond the rim of time,
I'll be His and He'll be mine,
Ever with the Lord shall I be.
