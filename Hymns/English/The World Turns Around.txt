The world turns around and the young men get old.
The people next door are all down with a cold.
The stars are in the heavens that's where they belong.
They don't shine in my world since baby is gone.
If I were a writer I'd write me a song,
But all I could say is my baby is gone.

They had a fire-sale down town yesterday.
They say the new courthouse will be finished right away.
The weather man said sunny but I know he's wrong.
I don't really care, cause my baby is gone.
If I were a traveler I'd go to Hong Kong and try to forget
That my baby is gone.

The sheep are in the meadow the cows are in the corn.
I'm here  a wishin', I'd never been born.
The newspaper says that the world's going wrong.
Ain't worried about the world cause my baby is gone.
If I were a singer, I'd sing me a song,
But who wants to sing when his baby is gone?
