1. Something we appreciate, a love that will communicate;
A tho'tfulness, someone so kind, to faults of others blind;
Always saying something good, a love that's always understood,
Sorting out the things we've heard and speaking golden words.

Chorus:
All is well when love is heard, when words we speak are golden words;
For words, like gold, will brighter shine, revealing love so pure and kind,
Coming from a Christlike mind, golden words.

2. Golden words, a melody, enrich the heart like harmony;
A word, like gold, that brighter shines in tho't, a Christlike mind.
Golden phrases softly touch, creating friendship, loving much,
Golden words that have no end will make a loving friend.

3. Love will seek and always find those tho'tful words so true and kind;
A friend that stands on guard for love, a word from heav'n above;
Always speaking words of cheer, creating friendships far and near;
Golden words of happiness this life to free from stress.
