1. While you are blessed with this precious moment,
Jesus is ready to say;
Sinner before you make your decision,
Is this your last chance to pray?

Chorus:
Before you say, 'no,' to Jesus tonight,
Before you turn Him away;
Before you decide to take that great chance
Is this your last chance to pray?

2. Can you be sure that you'll see tomorrow,
Would you be wise to wait?
For deaths chilling arms, tonight may embrace you,
Is this your last chance to pray?

3. Satan may say, that you're young and healthy,
There's plenty of time to pray,
But death is for sure and life is uncertain,
Is this your last chance to pray?
