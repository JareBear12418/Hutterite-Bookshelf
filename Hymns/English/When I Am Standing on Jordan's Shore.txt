1. When I'll be standing on Jordan's shore
Viewing my home so near,
Come to me, Savior, and guide me o'er,
Banishing all my fear.

Chorus:
Yonder in glorious realms of light!
Safe on the golden strand!
Pilot me, Savior, through darkest night,
Into that heav'nly land.

2. City of God with its portals fair,
Open the gates for me!
Rapturous place with its beauty rare,
There by the crystal sea.

3. Spirit of God hath revealed to me
Beautiful scenes of home;
Lov'd ones are waiting, from sin set free,
Beck'ning the wand'rer, 'Come'!

4. There shall I rest from all strife and care,
On my dear Savior's breast;
There will I gaze on His face so fair,
Dwelling among the blest.
