1. I will draw my strength from Jesus
As I lay upon his breast,
I will take my comfort from him
I will find in him sweet rest.

Chorus:
For there is no other fountain
Where I can be more satisfied
Than in the arms of Christ my savior
No blessings I will be denied.

2. All pain will leave my aching body
As his sweet healing nurture flows
Demons tremble in his presence
In Jesus name they have to go.

3. Some morning in that yonder city
I will awake to sleep no more.
In God's presence live forever
All sin and pain will all be o'er.
