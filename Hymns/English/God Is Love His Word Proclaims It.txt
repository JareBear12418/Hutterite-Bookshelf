1. 'God is Love!' His Word proclaims it,
Day by day the truth we prove;
Heav'n and earth with joy are telling,
Ever telling, 'God is Love!'

Chorus:
Hallelujah! tell the story,
Sung by angels choirs above,
Sounding forth the mighty chorus
'God is Light, God is Love!'

2. 'God is Love!' Oh, tell it gladly,
How the Savior from above
Came to seek and save the lost ones,
Showing thus the Father's love.

3. 'God is Love!' O boundless mercy
May we all its fullness prove!
Telling those who sit in darkness,
'God is Light, God is Love!'
