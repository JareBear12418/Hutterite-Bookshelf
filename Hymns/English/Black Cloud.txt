It all started in the garden when the world had just begun.
They were told that they could eat the fruit from every tree but one.
But the greed was there in woman and the weakness was in man
And the black cloud rose the day the world began.

 Chorus:No one saw the black cloud rising, no one heard the thunder roll.
No one saw the black cloud rising, take possession of man's soul.
It's that same cloud that rises over you and over me.
It's that black cloud of greed and jealousy.

Well the years went by in history and the world was doing fine.
And the rush for gold had started back in eighteen forty-nine.
But a man's life was worthless and his work was all in vain.
And the black cloud casts its shadow on his claim.

Dreams of peace have been shattered many threats have hurled.
And there's always a man who thinks he's here to rule the world.
Though it isn't in the contract and it isn't in the plan,
We can see the black cloud rising once again.
