1. As you have joined your hands in one
Before our God above,
May you, as Ruth of old has done,
Pledge now this vow of love.

Chorus: Whither thou goest, I will go;
Whither thou lodgest, I will lodge;
Thy people shall my people be,
Thy God my God.
(Thy God)
Thy people shall my people be,
Thy God my God.
(Thy God)

2. Though' to a country near or far,
You shall be called to go,
You'll live together for the Lord,
For you are his, we know.

3. In health or sickness, good or ill,
Faithful you'll be and true;
This is the vow, today, you've made,
Now, and for all life thru.
