1. Sometimes when I'm weary and I'm burdened down with care;
It seems there's no place to turn to,
It seems there's no one who cares;
But then I hear a voice saying, 'Child, I am here;'
Just bring your cares to Jesus, he is always standing near.

Chorus:
Just take your cares to Jesus,
He is always standing near;
Waiting to hear you call his name,
Waiting to answer your prayer;
So when you feel all burdened,
Get on your knees in prayer;
Take your cares to Jesus,
He is always standing near.

2. Now my burdens seem lighter as I travel on life's way,
I can reach out to others as I go about my way;
I took my cares to Jesus,
He heard and answered my prayer;
I found someone who loves me, I found Jesus standing near.

3. (verse for wedding)
As you begin this life together,
Of which you both so long have dreamed,
You may find that loving each other is not as easy as it seemed;
In times like these remember, the author of your love,
It's our precious Savior Jesus, who's with our Father up above.
