1. I woke up this morning and I walked out my door;
A new day was dawning I'd never seen before.
I looked up toward heaven and, Lord, I could see,
That you made this morning and you gave it to me.

Chorus:
Jesus, you just made my day,
All my dark clouds of burdens, they're all rolled away.
With joy all around me, I'd just like to say,
'I'm so thankful, Jesus, you just made my day!'

2. I once walked in the shadows and I felt so alone,
Till the darkness had vanished, at the breaking of dawn.
A heavenly light, is now shining my way.
I thank you, dear Jesus, you just made my day!
