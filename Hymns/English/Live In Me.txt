1. Live in me, Lord Jesus, live in me, (2.)
There's a work that must be done,
There's a victory to be won,
Every hour, by Thy power, live in me.

2. Work through me, Lord Jesus, work through me, (2.)
There's a work that must be done,
There's a victory to be won,
Every hour, by Thy power, work thru me.

3. Come for me, Lord Jesus, come for me, (2.)
When my work shall all be done,
And the victory is won,
In that hour, by Thy power, come for me.
