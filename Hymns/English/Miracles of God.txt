1. I heard the birds sing sweetly in the early morning hour
And I saw the sparkling dewdrop in the petal of a flower;
I saw the grass beneath me, spring back gently where I trod,
And I knew as I reflected, all were miracles of God.

2. I saw a cloud blow softly in the azure sky above,
And I felt the breeze blow gently, heard the cooing of a dove;
I saw the rippling Brooklet, heard its music where I trod,
And again the thought came to me, all were miracles of God.

3. I saw a fluffy snowbank in the winter's chilly air,
And I saw the mountain forest, and I saw the desert bare;
I saw the lovely sunset, saw its beauty where I trod,
And I knew the scenes I witnessed all were miracles of God.

4. I saw a boy run swiftly and I heard a baby's cry
And I saw the tender love light, shining in a mother's eye;
I thought that all around me, everywhere I chance to trod,
If I stop in meditation, I see miracles of God.
