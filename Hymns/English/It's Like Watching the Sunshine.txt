1. I never taught that I could sing a song
That would make the tears of joy roll down my face
All the burdens I have carried for so long
Jesus came and now my past has been erased.

Chorus:
It's like watching the sunshine for the first time
As a rainbow shows its colors through the rain
And the clover in the fields now look much greener
And I know my life will never be the same.

2. I wandered in a world I could not share
And from the clutches of its chilly hand
Into a life of joy beyond compare
And I never knew that life could be so grand.
