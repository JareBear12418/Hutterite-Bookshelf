1. On this muddy road of life,
As we come face to face with strife,
Pretend we go without God's help when we are lead;
Then the neighbors come around,
And help you out when you are down,
Are you treating your neighbor as yourself?

Chorus:
Are you treating your neighbor as yourself?
Are you treating your neighbor as yourself?
When indeed he needs a friend,
Would you help and invite him in?
Are you treating your neighbor as yourself?

2. In this world so filled with sin,
We live our lives among our friends,
How can you cheat your neighbor when you know it's wrong;
If we'd only work and pray,
And help some sinner find his way,
Read the precious old Bible and you'll see.

3. All our deeds that we have done,
Will come to life when Jesus comes,
Will you be ready for He's coming in the clouds?
For in that moment we feel
Could we say with our last breath?
I have treated my neighbor as myself.
