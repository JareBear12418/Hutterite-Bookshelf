1. In acceptance lieth peace, oh my heart be still,
Let thy restless worries cease and accept his will,
Though this test be not thy choice, it is his therefore rejoice;
In acceptance, in acceptance, lieth peace.

2. And cease from sighs and murmurings, seek his lovely face,
This thing means thy furthering to a wealthy place.
From thy fears he'll give release, in acceptance lieth peace;
In acceptance, in acceptance, lieth peace.

3. In his plan there cannot be, ought to make thee sad,
If this is his choice for thee, take it and be glad,
And make from it some lovely thing, for the glory of thy King;
In acceptance, in acceptance, lieth peace.
