1. 'The way you serve one another
Is the way that you serve me,
Was the words of our dear Savior
He wants us all to see.
He said to do unto others,
As you'd have them do to you-
I'm indebted to so many, Lord,
Their friendship has been true.

Chorus: My friends have been a blessing,
They're worth much more than gold;
I need them in my youthful days,
I'll need them when I'm old.
Of life's most cherished treasures
Are the things that have no end,
Are the blessings sent from you, dear Lord,
Given by my friends.

2. You can give without loving, - It happens everyday;
But to love without giving, - Is impossible they say.
It's been proven by the kindness
My friends have shown to me;
Help me, Lord, to be the blessing - That I truly want to be.
