1. Can you imagine, a rose without a fragrance
Can you imagine, a bird without a song?
Can you imagine, a brook without its waters?
That's what my life was like till I met Jesus Christ.

Chorus:
O I love, love, love Him in the morning,
All day long I learn to trust Him more and more;
I will praise, praise, praise Him for a hundred million years,
And then I'll praise Him for a hundred million more.

2. Can you imagine, a day without a dawning?
Can you imagine, a sky without a star?
Can you imagine, the earth without a heaven?
That's what my life was like till I met Jesus Christ.

3. Can you imagine, a ship without a harbor?
Can you imagine, a train without a track?
Can you imagine, a life without a meaning?
That's what my life was like till I met Jesus Christ.
