1. These two hearts together at the altar,
Now aglow with fire of love divine;
They are turned into one sacred union
Hand in hand for now and for all times.

Chorus:
Hand in hand together on life's pathway,
Hand in hand for one another here;
Hand in hand together live for Jesus
Spreading love and comfort, hope and cheer.

2. May their home reflect the love of Jesus,
And be given to hospitality;
Hand in hand they live for good of others
And together live, oh, Lord, for Thee.

3. Hand in hand with great anticipation,
Facing future that is yet unknown;
Hand in hand they put their trust in Jesus
Trusting Him the way they will be shown.
