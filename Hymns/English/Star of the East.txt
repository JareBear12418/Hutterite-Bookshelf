1. Star of the East, O Bethlehem Star,
Guiding us on to heaven afar;
Sorrow and grief are lulled by thy light,
Thou hope of each mortal in death's lonely night;
Fearless and tranquil we look up to thee,
Knowing thou beam'st thro' eternity;
Help us to follow where thou still dost guide,
Pilgrims of earth so wide.

Chorus:
Star of the East, thou hope of the soul,
While around us the dark billows roll:
Lead us from sin to glory afar,
Thou star of the East, thou sweet Bethlehem star.

2. Star of the East, undimmed by each cloud,
What if the storms of grief gather loud?
Faithful and pure thy rays beam to save,
Still bright o'er the cradle and bright o'er the grave;
Smiles of a Savior are mirrored in thee,
Glimpses of heav'n in thy light we see;
Guide us still onward to that blessed shore,
After earth's toil is o'er.
