1. God is love, lift up your voice and shout it,
God is love, lets tell the world about it,
He made the rivers and the rolling seas,
He made the birds and the humming bees
He made them all for you and me, God is love.

Chorus:
God is love, I can feel it in the air,
I can feel it everywhere, I can feel His tender care;
From the deepest ocean, to the highest heaven above,
All creation tells me, God is love.

2. God is love, open up your heart and show it,
God is love, He wants the world to know it;
He made the moon and the stars that shine,
He made the flowers and the rumbling pine,
He made them all by far divine, God is love.

3. God is love, heaven and earth declare it,
God is love, He wants the world to share it;
He made a way for fallen man,
Lifted him up by His mighty hand,
Gave him a place in gloryland, God is love.
