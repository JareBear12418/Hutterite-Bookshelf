Chorus: You are the words and the music;
You are the song that I sing.
You are the melody, you are the harmony,
Praise to your name I will bring.
You are the Lord of lords,
You are the mighty God,
You are the King of all kings,
So now I give back to you the song that you gave to me,
You are the song that I sing.

1. Spreading your truth unto every land,
Building your kingdom with hearts and hands;
The whole world resounds with your praise.
Humbly we bow down to worship you,
Bending we lift up our eyes to you;
The rocks cry out, praising your name.

2. Living together in unity,
Joining our voices in harmony;
The melody flows from our praise.
All that we are and we'll ever know,
All that we have is a gift from you;
All glory and honor is yours.
