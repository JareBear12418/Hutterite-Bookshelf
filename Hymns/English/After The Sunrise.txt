1. Sorrows surround us while treading life's road,
Troubles confound us, make heavy our load;
Fetters that bound us, no longer will goad,
After the sunrise, how happy we'll be.

Chorus:
After the sunrise, happy we'll be.
(We know after the sunrise,)
Jesus we'll see (in heaven;)
All will be glory, singing the story,
After the sunrise, how happy we'll be.

2. Shadows will vanish when morning shall come,
Lovelight will banish sin's vapors like scum;
Even the clanish together will hum,
After the sunrise, how happy we'll be.

3. Angels are waiting to carry the news,
Why stand debating, why longer refuse?
Cease all your hating, be changing your views,
After the sunrise, how happy we'll be.
