1. Lord, the first time you came here,
There was no one to receive you;
Just a stable for a place to lay your head.
And on a dark winter's evening,
With the star to mark your presence,
There came wise men to worship,
And they were kneeling by your bed.

Chorus: And it still takes a wise man to bow before the King,
To worship and adore you more than any earthly thing
We offer up a sacrifice of praise for you today,
And it still takes a wise man to pray.

2. And with great anticipation, Lord,
We wait for your returning;
For the bridegroom
To come and take His bride away.
And so I'll tend unto my labor,
For the fields are white and ready,
For the harvest to be gathered on that day.

Lord, help me be a wise man today
