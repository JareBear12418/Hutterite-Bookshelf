1. I have a shepherd, one I love so well,
How He has blessed me, tongue can never tell;
On the cross He suffered, shed His blood and died,
That I might ever in His love confide.

Chorus:
Following Jesus ever day by day,
Nothing can harm me, when He leads the way;
Sunshine or shadows, what'ere befall
Jesus my Shepherd is my all in all.

2. Pastures abundant doth His hands provide,
Still waters flowing ever at my side;
Goodness and mercy follow on my track
With such a Shepherd nothing can I lack.

3. When I would wander, from the paths astray,
Then He will draw me back unto the way;
In the darkest valley I need fear no ill,
For He my Shepherd will be with me still.
