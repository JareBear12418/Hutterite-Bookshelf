1. There's a flight leaving here in the morning
Destination was charted long ago
Now the Captain is ready and waiting
But the engines are still idling low
Waiting now for those who still linger
With unclaimed tickets free to every man
Reservations secured by the Savior
On this one-way flight to glory land

Chorus: All aboard the Master calleth from the runway
For our leaving is almost at hand
Make your way to the tollgate of Calvary
For this one-way flight to Glory land.

2. Now this flight is for all those believing
And our Pilot is Jesus God's Son
And the passengers are all boarded safely
They're prepared for this heavenly run
My brother don't let this flight leave without you
Pursue now those who are on board to say good-bye
Make your way to the tollgate of Calvary
And confirm your reservations to the sky.
