1. Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee;
E'en though it be a cross
That raiseth me,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

2. Tho' like a wanderer,
Daylight all gone,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone,
Yet in my dreams I'd be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

3. There let the way appear,
Steps up to heav'n;
All that Thou sendest me,
In mercy giv'n;
Angels to beckon me,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

4. Then with my waking tho'ts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony grieves
Bethel I'll raise,
So by my woes to be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

5. Or if on joyful wing,
Cleaving the sky,
Caught up to meet my King,
Swiftly I fly,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
