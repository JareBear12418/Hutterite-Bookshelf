1. The rich man has the advantage on earth,
And money he does crave;
But there's one thing he cannot do,
Take it with him to the grave.

Chorus:
No matter how high in society they go,
Or how much money they save;
When they close their eyes in death,
They can only fill one grave.

2. The rich man lives in his mansion so fine,
The poor man walks the street;
But when this world is set on fire,
They'll both their Savior meet,

3. There'll be one gate the rich won't get through,
For money can't buy their way in.
For the Bible plainly says,
That money's the root of all sins.
