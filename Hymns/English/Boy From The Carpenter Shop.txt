1. Born in a stable, His mother a virgin,
Raised in a carpenter shop.
His people were slaves, His parents were poor,
His friends a lowly lot.
His chances in life are very slim,
He's expected to be a slave.
But people in darkness saw light in Him,
And hope of freedom He gave.

2. All of the powers in heaven and earth,
God had vested in Him.
He's to die on the cross descend into hell,
Meet the devil and take the keys from him.
He yielded Himself to the death on the cross,
Cried, 'It's finished!' then slumped to die.
In the regions of hell the devil celebrated,
'We've destroyed the King!' he cried.

3. In the midst of the celebration, Footsteps were heard;
Walking the corridors of hell.
Then the shouting stopped and a voice rang out,
A voice that rang like a bell.
Satan trembled as he recognized Him,
Who had come to deliver His own;
'Shut and lock the gate!' he cried,
'Don't let Him ascend to His throne!'

4. So the gate swung shut in the face of the King,
To prove God's salvation untrue.
But He shook hell's gates, and He cried, 'Lift up your head,
the King is coming thru!'
Then out of the devil's prison house came;
A procession led by the King,
Shouting, 'Now, O grave where is thy victory,
And death where is thy sting?'

5. Who is the King of glory?
The Lord God, mighty in battle is He.
Who is the King of glory?
The Master and Host of heaven supreme;
Who is the King of glory?
The one that not even death could stop,
He is the King of glory,
The little boy from the carpenter shop.
