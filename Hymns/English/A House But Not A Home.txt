1. A house but not a home, was the picture Satan painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our Daddy would frown while Mother was praying
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe

2. In anger he swore his voice cold and loud
His Sundays were spent out with the gambling crowd
I'd never seen my Daddy inside the house of God
For Satan held his hand down the path of sin he trod

3. Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called our mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our Daddy to raise their children right

4. The angels rejoiced in heaven last night
I heard Daddy praying dear God make things right
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While Mother with angels rejoiced last night
