1. Two young men stood upon the street,
Twas on a summer's eve,
And they were brothers you could see,
The one seemed fair to me;
The other was dressed in uniform,
With God's love in His heart,
He took the other by the hand,
'Dear brother we must part.'

2. 'Oh, won't you come and go with me,'
I heard the brother say,
'Your Savior loves you brother dear,
He's pleading night and day;
Oh, won't you come to the Gospel Hall,
And there give God your heart,
And we can roam in heaven where
We never more shall part,'

3. 'No, I must go and join the boys
And have another spree,
But I will come tomorrow night,'
He promised faithfully;
'Yes, I will come tomorrow night
And evermore do right,
But brother dear, we now must part
Until tomorrow night.'

4. Tomorrow night, it never came
For this young man again,
For he was taken from this world
So full of sin and shame;
His brother by the coffin sat,
With teardrops in his eyes,
For he remembered those last words,
'I'll come tomorrow night.'

5. 'Why did you wait till tomorrow night,'
I heard him sadly say,
'If he had given God his heart,
I could meet him some sweet day;'
Oh, do not wait till Jesus calls,
But look unto the light,
For death may overtake you all,
Before tomorrow night.
