1. In a manger long ago, I know it's really so,
The son of God was born to set man free;
He was born, He lived, He died, on the cross was crucified,
And I love, I love that man of Galilee.

Chorus:
O I love, I love that man of Galilee,
For He's done so very much for me,
He's forgiven me all my sins, placed the Holy Ghost within,
And I love, I love that man of Galilee.

2. Nicodemus came by night, to see if the way was right,
But the Lord said unto him, 'Be born again;'
So my friend if you would have, eternal life then you must give,
Give your life unto that man of Galilee.
