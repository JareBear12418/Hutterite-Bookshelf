1. When all my friends seem far away
down this dusty gravel road
And their smile is taken by the winds that blow
When the tides of life are threatening me
and all hope and joy are gone
There's a voice that tells me I am not alone
Chorus
I can see a bright lightThere's a light in the window
I can see a bright light
Lit by some dear hand to set me free
I can see a bright lightThere's a light in the window
I can see a bright light
'Tis a precious friend who cares for me

2. When darkness falls and coyotes call
in the blackness of the night
When there's no one there to answer it's all right
There's a gentle ray that comes my way
from the distant eastern sky
And it tells me that my Lord is at my side

3. I see the birds up in the tree, and I feel the gentle breeze
There's a calming reassurance there for me
From the run-down shack that calls me back
I can hear a voice ring low
Leave your cares behind and trust the one you know.
