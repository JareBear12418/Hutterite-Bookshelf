1. There's a city of light, 'mid the stars we are told,
Where they know not a sorrow or care;
And the gates are of pearl and the streets are of gold,
And the buildings exceedingly fair.
Chorus
Let us pray for each other, Not faint by the way,
In this sad world of sorrow and care;
For that home is so bright and it's almost in sight,
And I trust in my heart you'll go there.

2. Brother dear, never fear, we shall triumph at last,
If we trust in the word He has given;
When our trials and our toils, and our weepings are past,
We shall meet in that home up in heav'n.

3. Let us walk in the light of the gospel divine,
Let us ever keep near to the cross;
Let us love, watch: and pray, in our pilgrimage here,
Let us count all things else but as loss.
