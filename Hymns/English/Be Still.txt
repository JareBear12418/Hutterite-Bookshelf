1. Each day you are walking, my brother,
Too close to the edge of the shore,
A wave may rush in without warning
And sweep you away from your door.
Remember the sea has no mercy,
Your cry may be lost on the waves;
The prayer on your lips never answered
Your heart vainly longs for a friend.

Chorus:
Be still, while the sunshine is with you,
Be still, while the clouds are yet gone;
Behold, the dear Master is waiting
To welcome the prodigal home.

2. His blood was the price of our pardon,
Our lifeline to heaven above;
Before a great tempest surrounds you
Hold fast to His undying love.
With sadness He watches your journey
And tenderly calls you by name;
The hour is late, but the Savior
Will help you start over again.
