1. I knelt to pray, but not for long,
I had too much to do,
Must hurry off and get to work,
For bills would soon be due.

2. And so I said, a hurried prayer,
Jumped up from off my knees;
My Christian duty now was done,
My soul would be at ease.

3. All through the day I had no time
To speak a word of cheer,
No time to speak of Christ to friends
They'd laugh at me, I feared.

4. No time, no time, too much to do
That was my constant cry;
No time to give to those in need
At last 'twas time to die.

5. And when before the Lord I came,
I stood with downcast eyes,
Within His hands He held a Book,
It was the 'Book of Life.'

6. God looked into His Book and said,
'Your name I cannot find,
I once was going to write it down,
But never found the time.'
