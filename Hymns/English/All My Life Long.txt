1. All my life long I had panted
For a draw from some cool spring;
That I hoped would quench the burning,
Of the thirst I felt within.

Chorus:
Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul' so long has craved;
Jesus satisfies my longing
Thro His blood I now am saved.

2. Feeding on the husks around me
Till my strength was almost gone;
Longed my soul for something better
Only still to hunger on.

3. Poor was I and sought for riches
Something that would satisfy;
But the dust I gathered round me,
Only mocked my soul's sad cry.

4. Well of water ever springing
Bread of life so rich and free;
Untold wealth that never faileth,
My Redeemer is to me.
