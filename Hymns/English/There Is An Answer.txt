1. So many questions that go unanswered-
Why pain and heartaches on ev'ry hand?
Who has the courage to keep on going?
Why all these troubles, who understands?

Chorus: (answer)(question)
There is an answer for every question
There are no secrets, our Savior sees.
(He had the) courage to keep on going;
Up Calvary's mountain for you and me.

2. Yes, there'll be trials and tribulations,
More grace abounding to stand the test;
Just take up courage and keep on going,
When life is over, eternal rest.

3. Our Savior left us this precious promise,
'If you'll be faithful until the end;
There waits in heaven a crown of glory,
And I'll be with you; I'll be your friend.'

4. Someday in heaven there'll be no heartaches,
No pain or sorrow will e'er annoy;
There all our questions will all be answered
When we see Jesus, oh, perfect joy!
