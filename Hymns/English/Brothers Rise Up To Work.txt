1. Brothers rise up to work, serve the Lord and our King,
Let us go on His way in our hearts let us sing;
For its power from on high that renews day by day,
Follow love's great command and its call now obey.

Chorus:
Faithful be, (Faithful be,) constantly, (constantly,)
Serve the Lord (Serve the Lord) joyfully; (joyfully;)
Victory (Is near) nigh the day, (the crown,)
So work until the Master comes.

2. We are called by the Lord to watch on the wall,
Cry out loud the good news that He brought to us all;
Make it known everywhere sinful man He has freed,
Now redemption is here through His glorious deed.

3. Brothers seek out the lost just as Jesus has shown,
Give the poor sustenance, comfort those all alone;
Shine a light in the dark of this world's grief and pain,
Show the enemy love as the Lord has ordained.

4. For the glory of God, let us take up the fight,
'Gainst the armies of death and the world with its might,
Let us rise up in strength here is work for us all,
Who is faithful to God no harm can befall.
