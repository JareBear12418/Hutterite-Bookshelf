Roses shed their sweetest fragrance
When the night is dark and all is calm and still (is calm and still)
In the darkest hours of our crushing burdens
God is working out his holy will.

Roses shed their sweetest fragrance
in the darkest hours of this earthly night.
So our pain and heartache sheds a fragrance
that is truly precious in the savior's sight.

Streams of water sing the grandest
anthems when they meet obstructions on the race (yes on the race)
So the music of our hearts is better
tuned to heaven by the obstacles we face

Eagles soar to greatest heights above
the clouds when lifted by contrary winds (contrary winds)
So our spirits rise to greatest heights of victory
by the gusts of conflict we are in.

All our light affliction is but
for a moment and is working for our gain (yes for our gain)
which will be a far more and exceeding
and eternal wave of glory to obtain.
