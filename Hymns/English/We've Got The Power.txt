Chorus:
We've got the power in the name of Jesus,
We've got the power in the name of the Lord.
Though Satan rages, we will not be defeated;
We've got the power in the name of the Lord.

1. Many years now, Satan tried to stop us,
But the church of Jesus is still alive;
Like a mighty army we keep marching onward,
Win every battle with the Lord by our side.
