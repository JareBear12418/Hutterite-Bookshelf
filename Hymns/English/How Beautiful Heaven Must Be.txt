1. We read of a place that's called Heaven;
It's made for the pure and the free;
These truths in God's word He hath given,
How beautiful heaven must be.
Chorus
How beautiful heaven must be, ( must be )
Sweet home of the happy and free;
Fair haven of rest for the weary,
How beautiful heaven must be.

2. In heaven no drooping nor pining.
No wishing for elsewhere to be;
God's light is forever there shining,
How beautiful heaven must be.

3. Pure waters of life there are flowing,
And all who drink may be free;
Rare jewels of splendor are glowing
How beautiful heaven must be.

4. The angels so sweetly are singing,
Up there by the beautiful sea;
Sweet chords from their gold harps are ringing,
How beautiful heaven must be.
