I finally found the words to say
How long did I intend to stay.
I know you've wondered now and then
How close our love is to the end.

I think it's only fair that you know
That one of these days I'll have to go.
But I'll be proud to wear your ring
Till I'm just a picture in a frame.

Storm clouds may gather and the heavy rains may come.
When the storms are over we'll still share the golden sun.
And I'll still love you just the same
Till I'm just a picture in a frame.

I hope this small bouquet of words
Are the sweetest ones you've ever heard.
'Cause I can't think of anyone
I'd rather hold till life is done.

This love of mine for you will grow and grow
And I just thought that you would like to know;
My love will be a burning flame
Till I'm just a picture in a frame.

Storm clouds may gather and the heavy rains may come.
When the storms are over we'll still share the golden sun.
And I'll still love you just the same
Till I'm just a picture in a frame.

Yes, I'll still love you just the same
Till I'm just a picture in a frame.
