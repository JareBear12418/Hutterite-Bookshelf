1. There's a place I've heard a lot about,
And in my mind there is no doubt,
That such a place is waiting up on high;
I'd like go up there someday,
At the end of time I'll wait and say,
'Hello' to friends, to whom I've said good-bye

Chorus:
H-e-a-v-e-n that spells heaven,
I'd like to go up there when life on earth is o'er;
H-e-a-v-e-n that spells heaven
I long to walk along that golden shore.

2. I hope the Lord will take me in,
Up there where tears and sorrows end,
Where cares and worries trouble me no more;
I hope He'll take my hand and say,
'My child, I'm glad you're here today,
You're welcome in my home for evermore.'
