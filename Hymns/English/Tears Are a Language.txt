1. Often you've wondered why tears come into our eyes
Things have not turned out the way that you have planned
But God is standing near, He sees your falling tears
Tears are a language, God understands.

Chorus: God sees the tears of a broken heart and soul
He sees your tears and hears them when they fall
God weeps along with man and takes him by the hand
Tears are a language, God understands.

2. When grief has left you low, He causes tears to flow
When burdens seem to be much more than you can bear
But God won't forget you, His promises are true
Tears are a language, God understands.
(repeat chorus)

Tears are a language, God understands.
