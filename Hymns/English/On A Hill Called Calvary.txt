1. On a hill called Calvary,
Jesus, my Lord, suffered for me;
Carried the cross on that day, my sins to atone.
Then they nailed him to the cross;
Great was the pain and the cost.
And he suffered it all, (And he suffered it all)
Because he loved me. (Because he loved me)

Chorus:
Because he loved me, my Savior died,
On the cross was crucified.
No greater love, by mortal man, has ever been known.
Oh, praise his dear name, I love him so.
I am his, he's mine I know.
And he suffered it all, (And he suffered it all)
Because he loved me. (Because he loved me)

2. Then they carried him away, placed him in a lowly grave.
Surely they thought that this would be, the end of this man.
But on the third and glorious day,
God came and rolled the stone away.
And he rose from the dead, (end he rose from the dead)
Because he loved me. (Because he loved me)
