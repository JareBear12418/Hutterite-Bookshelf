Melody: (Nun ruhen alle WÃ¤lder)

1. In fellowship together
With blessings gracious father
In thy dear name we pray
Two hearts now stand before thee
Oh, grant that they adore thee
Thy presence on their wedding day.

2. Unite their hearts, O, Savior
And grant thy loving favor
Upon this marriage bond
Oh, bless this sacred hour
Thy love upon them shower
When hearts and hands unite in one.

3. What God has joined together
Those ties no one should sever
That house is ever blest
Oh, lay thy hand upon them
Be thou this day and onward
Their favored and most homeward guest.
