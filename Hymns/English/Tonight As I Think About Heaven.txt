1. Tonight as I think about heaven,
And I think of my mother up there;
I wonder if she knows I'm a Christian,
And knows God has answered her prayers.

2. She was always praying for me,
That I meet her in heaven someday;
Last night I took Christ for my Savior,
So thank God I'm going that way.

3. I know that my daddy's in heaven,
Were the last words I heard mother say;
'Dear husband I'll soon be there with you,'
She smiled and then passed away.

4. For He helped me when I was in trouble,
When I needed Him, He answered my prayers;
So the reason I'm homesick for heaven,
I know I'll see Jesus up there.

5. Sometimes I get homesick for heaven,
And I want to see mother and dad;
But first I want to see Jesus,
The best friend that I ever had.

6. I know that my daddy's in heaven,
Were the last words I heard mother say;
'Dear husband I'll soon be there with you,'
She smiled and then passed away.
