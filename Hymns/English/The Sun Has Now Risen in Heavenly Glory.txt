1. The sun has now risen in heavenly glory,
And shines through the darkness of night.
Now rejoice and sing praises, yea, shout the glad story,
For in Christ the Redeemer is healing and light.

Chorus:
To God be the glo - ry
(To God be the Glory, to God be the glory,)
And good will to men;
(Peace and goodwill to men,)
Through Christ our Redeem - - er
(Through Christ our Redeemer, Christ our Redeemer)
Shall peace come again.
(Peace and goodwill will come again.)

2. The world lay benighted in death and destruction;
All mankind in sin was forlorn.
But through faith in the Savior comes peace and salvation;
Sing with joy, all ye ransom'd, the Savior is born!

3. Now go with the shepherds and follow the wise men
To seek for the heavenly Child.
And when ye have found Him, accept and adore Him,
The Christ-child from glory so gentle and mild.
