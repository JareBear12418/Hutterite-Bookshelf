1. How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream,
When memory recalls them now and then!
And with the rapture sweet my weary heart would beat,
If I could hear my mother. pray again.

Chorus:
If I could hear my mother pray again,
(If I could only)
If I could hear her' tender voice as then!
(If I could only)
So glad I'd be, 'twould mean so much to me,
(happy I should)
If I could hear my mother pray again.

2. She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely,
And always walk the shining gospel way;
So trusting still His love I seek that home above,
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day.

3. Within the old homeplace, her patient, smiling face,
Was always spreading comfort, hope and cheer;
And when she used to sing to her eternal King,
It was the songs the angels loved to hear.

4. Her work on earth is done, the lifecrown has been won,
And she will be at rest with Him above;
And some glad morning, she I know will welcome me
To that eternal home of peace and love.
