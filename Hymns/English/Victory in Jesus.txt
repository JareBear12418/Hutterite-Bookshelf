1. I heard an old, old story, How a Savior came from glory,
How He gave his life on Calvary to save a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning, Of His precious blood's atoning,
Then I repented of my sins and won the victory.

Chorus:
Oh, victory in Jesus, my Savior, forever,
He sought me and bo't me with His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory, beneath the cleansing flood.

2. I heard about His healing, Of His cleansing pow'r revealing,
How He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see;
And then, I cried, 'Dear Jesus, Come and heal my broken spirit,'
And somehow Jesus came and bro't to me the victory.

3. I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the street of gold beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing, and the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of victory.
