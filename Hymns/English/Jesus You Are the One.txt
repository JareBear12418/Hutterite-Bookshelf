1. Sometimes I'm all alone, with no one to share,
My problems and heartaches, I can't seem to bear;
Then Jesus comes - whispering love in my ear,
Fills me with sweet joy, and hold me so near.

Chorus:
Jesus you are the one, You make my day bright,
When I can't see the sun. Jesus; I need only You;
To lead me and guide me,
Till my life here is through, Jesus.

2. Sometimes I look around, there's some feeling low,
To see what has happened, in this world here below;
Then I remember - His coming our day,
When Jesus will take all, His children away.
