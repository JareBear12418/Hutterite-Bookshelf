1. Come, ye sinners, lost and hopeless,
Jesus' blood can make you free;
For He saved the worst among you,
When He saved a wretch like me.

Chorus:
And I know, (I surely know,) yes, I know, (I surely know,)
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean,
And I know, (I surely know,) yes, I know, (I surely know,)
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean.

2. To the faint He giveth power,
Thro' the mountains makes a way;
Findeth water in the desert,
Turns the night to golden day.
3.
In temptation He is near thee,
Holds the pow'rs of hell at bay;
Guides you to the path of safety,
Gives you grace for ev'ry day.

4. He will keep thee while the ages,
Roll thro' out eternity;
Though earth hinders and hell rages,
All must work for good to thee.
