1. As I journey through valleys of sorrow,
Where the way seems so strange and unknown;
Lord, you know I need a helping hand to borrow,
For I can't find the way all alone.:.:

2. I don't have here no other hand to guide me,
I'm so small, I'm so weak and undone;
Come and walk a little closer, Lord, beside me,
For I can't find the way all alone.:.:

3. When the raging storms of life's filth have found me,
Lord, I pray wilt Thou keep me Thy own;
Let me feel Thy precious arms tight around me,
For I can't find the way all alone.:.:

4. Lord, I can't find the way here without Thee,
O dear Lord, look upon me from Thy throne;
Make me worthy to let the light shine around me,
For I can't find the way all alone. :.:
