1. In my mem'ry there's a picture,
Of a face so dear to me;
Loving arms that used to hold me,
As I sat on mother's knee.

Chorus:
She was fond of pretty flowers,
I recall she used to say;
'When I'm gone, son, please remember,
A pretty wreath for mother's grave.'

2. No one here on earth can pay her,
For the things in life she gave;
Now she's gone but I remember
A pretty wreath for mother's grave.

3. She had a little row of flowers,
That she used to watch each day;
She fixed them just before God called her,
So they would not fade away.

4. Next year they'll bloom again in beauty,
Red and blue so bright and gay;
If it's God's will I'll take them to her,
A pretty wreath for mother's grave.
