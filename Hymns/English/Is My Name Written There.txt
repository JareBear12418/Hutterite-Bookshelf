1. Lord, I care not for riches,
Neither silver nor gold,
I would make sure of heaven
I would enter the fold;
In the Book of Thy kingdom
With its pages so fair;
Tell me, Jesus my Savior,
Is my name written there?

Chorus:
Is my name written there,
On the page white and fair?
In the Book of Thy kingdom,
Is my name written there?

2. Lord, my sins they are many,
Like the sands of the sea,
But Thy blood, O my Savior
Is sufficient for me;
For Thy promise is written
In bright letters that glow,
Tho your sins be as scarlet,
I will make them like snow.

3. O that beautiful city
With its mansions of light,
With its glorified beings,
In pure garments of white;
Where no evil thing cometh
To despoil what is fair,
Where the angels are watching,
Is my name written there?
