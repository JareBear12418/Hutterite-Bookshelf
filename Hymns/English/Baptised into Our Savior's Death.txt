1. Baptised into our Savior's death,
Our souls to sin must die,
With Christ our Lord we live anew,
With Christ ascend on high.

2. There by His father's side He sits,
Enthroned divinely fair,
Yet owns Himself our Brother still,
And our forerunner there.

3. Rise from these earthly trifles, rise,
On wings of faith and love,
Above, our choicest treasure lies,
And be our hearts above.

4. Let not earth's pleasures draw us down,
Lord, give us strength to rise,
And thro' thy strong, attractive pow'r,
At last to gain the prize.
