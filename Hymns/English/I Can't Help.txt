1. I can't help what people say, they can't hurt me,
Makes no difference how they scoff or what they say;
I believe God's just the same, blessed be His holy name;
I can't help what people say, they can't hurt me.

Chorus:
I can't help what others do, I must go on
Till I reach at last, that bright eternal home;
That the Lord said He'll prepare, by His grace
I'm going there I can't help what others do, I must go on.

2. I can't help what Satan tries, he can't stop me,
For I have Christ's Spirit dwelling now in me;
And the One who dwells in me, is a greater one than he;
I can't help what Satan tries, he can't stop me
