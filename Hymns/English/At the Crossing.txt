1. There's a river somewhere that's called Jordon
And they say that it's deep and it's wide;
And they say that the king and the beggar
On the shore will stand side by side.

Chorus:
At the crossing of the Jordon
(At the crossing of the Jordon)
Why should I be afraid, There'll be someone there
Who loves me, to guide me cross the river,
(to guide me cross the river)
To endless joys above.

2. Though the river is dark and stormy
It will pass like a dream in the night;
And my soul will awake in the morning
In the regions of endless delight.
