1. Lord, here I am again, down on my knees in prayer;
And Lord, you promised me that you would always meet me there;
Now there's a mountain up ahead that I can't seem to climb,
But I'm praying for the strength to try it one more time.

Chorus: Lord, don't move that mountain,
just give me strength to climb;
For if you move each mountain,
I might grow weaker every time;
And just as your son, Jesus,
took the cross up Calvary's hill;
Lord, don't move that mountain,
so I may better do your will.

2. Now if there were no mountains, Lord, I might forget to pray,
And if there were no trials, Lord, I might even stray;
But I know the higher the mountain the sweeter the victory;
Oh Lord, ever remind me that you will walk beside of me.
