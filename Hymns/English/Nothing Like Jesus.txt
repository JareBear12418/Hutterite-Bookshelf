1. There is nothing in the world like Jesus;
He's the treasure of my soul.
When I'm troubled he dispels my sorrow;
When I'm weak he makes me whole.

Chorus:
Oh, I love to tell the merits of my Savior!
Every soul I can to win.
Oh, I love to tell the story of his power!
How he saves and keeps from sin.

2. There is nothing in the world like Jesus;
He supplies my every need.
And when others whom I trust betray me,
He remains a friend indeed.

3. Oh, there's no one in the world like Jesus,
Sympathetic, kind and true;
If it were not that I know and trust him,
I know not what I should do.

4. Have you troubles in your life, my brother?
Does your soul ache day by day?
If you'd bring your burdens all to Jesus,
He will bear them all away.
