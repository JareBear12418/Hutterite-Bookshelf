Have you failed in life's battles to accomplish your plan?

Is your heart heavy laden do you fear the Lord's command?

Do you feel that no one loves you and there's no use to try?

Just bring your cares to Jesus your soul he'll satisfy.



Chorus

Pick up the broken pieces and bring them to the Lord.

Pick up the broken pieces trust in his holy word.

He will put them back together and make your life complete.

Just place the broken pieces at the Savior's feet.



 You may feel that there's no hope broken hearts just cannot mend

Though you're torn in many pieces Christ can make you whole again.

Storms of doubt blow all directions but don't be afraid.

God can make all corrections; he made a body out of clay.
