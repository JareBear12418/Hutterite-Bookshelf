1. Many stars were shining brightly on one peaceful, holy night.
Wise men gazed and watched their movements from below,
Till they saw a strange one moving, it was shining fair and bright.
They had never seen one like it there before.

Chorus:
Sweetly sleeping in a manger in a loving mother's care,
Jesus had no downy pillow for His head.
Many a babe is sweetly sleeping, wrapped in lux'ry ev'rywhere,
While little Jesus had a manger for His bed.

2. Beautiful star that crowned the heavens, led the wise men on and on.
Soon it stopped and near a holy, little place.
There they worshipped God in heaven, knew the Holy One was born.
They received their loving Savior face to face.

3. From that rugged, wooden manger Jesus grew a promised child,
Told His story to the ones He knew were lost.
Then He proved how much He loved us, paid the debt for you and me,
When He died in shame upon the cruel tree.
