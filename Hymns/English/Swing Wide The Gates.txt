1. Heaven's gates I now can see
As they open wide for me;
Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home.
(Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home)
Angels sing a welcome song,
And I know it can't be long;
Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home.
(Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home)
Chorus:
Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home,
(Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home)
Swing wide the gatesI'm one of his own;
(Swing wide the gatesI'm one of his own)
I've fought a good fight, I've kept the faith,
Amazing grace has won the race;
Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home.
(Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home)

2. What a day that day will be
When I cross that mystic sea;
Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home.
(Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home)
With my Lord I'll ever be,
Throughout all eternity;
Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home.
(Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home)

3. When I land on heaven's shore,
Cares of life will be no more;
Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home.
(Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home)
All is joy and peace up there
In a land of beauty rare;
Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home.
(Swing wide the gatesI'm coming home)
