1. Thru my disappointment, Strife and discontentment,
I cast my every care on the Lord;
No matter what obsession, pain or deep depression,
I'm standing on the solid rock.

Chorus:
I'm stand - - ing on the rock of ages
(Standing on the rock, on the rock of ages)
Safe - - - from all the storm that rages;
(Safe from every storm, all the storms that rages)
Rich but not from Satan's wages
(Rich in love I'm rich, but not from satan's wages)
I'm standing on the solid rock.

2. Even Though He's gone now, I don't feel alone now,
With comfort came the spirit of the Lord;
Now with His words to guide me, From temptation hide me,
I'm standing on the solid rock.

3. Now I'm pressing onward, Each step leads me homeward,
I'm trusting in my Savior day by day;
Close is our relation, Firm is it's foundation,
So on this solid rock I stay.
