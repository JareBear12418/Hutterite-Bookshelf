Chorus:
Hear my cry, O God,
Listen to my prayer, listen to my song,
Singing praises all along.

1. I call on you again, for you have called me friend,
You have called me friend,
So I call on you once again.

2. With a weary heart,
I feel so far apart, feel so far apart,
With a weary, weary heart.

3. Hold me in your arms,
Shelter me from harm, shelter me from harm,
Hold me, hold me in your arms.

4. Hear again my vow,
I will serve you now, I will serve you now,
Hear again, Lord, hear my vow.

5. We praise you, Jesus Christ,
For you have given life, you have given life,
By your holy, precious blood.
