1. I heard the angels sing, 'Glory, hallelujah!'
A mighty chorus way up high;
I heard the angels sing, praise the name of Jesus,
Singing in God's choir in the sky.

Chorus:
I heard a thousand trumpets sounding out His glory,
Telling the story how He came on earth to die;
I heard a million voices praise the name of Jesus,
Singing in God's choir in the sky.

2. I heard the glorious song coming out of heaven,
The sweetest music ever heard;
I heard a mighty song sung by all the angels,
My soul thrilled at ev'ry loving word.

3. I fell down on my knees when the chorus ended,
They shouted out a glad Amen;
I fell down on my knees, prayed that when in heaven,
I would hear that choir once again.
