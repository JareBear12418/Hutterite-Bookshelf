1. Sailing on the sea of life,
My faith is in the Savior;
His love provides an anchor for my soul.
Though my lot it be to sail the face of troubled waters,
I rest secure in his control.

Chorus:
I'll be content to sail the face of troubled waters;
While billows dash and toss around my soul.
If I can only have his sacred presence near me
And I know that Jesus has control.

2. My Savior promised grace to face the raging billows,
Though Satan tries his very worst to do.
The storms may beat in all their bitter fury 'round me;
Yet Jesus said, 'I'll see you thru.'

3. He does not promise me a life of easy sailing,
Nor yet that I should never troubled be.
But in the midst of all the storms that come upon me,
His promise is I'll be with thee.
