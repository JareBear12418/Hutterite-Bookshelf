1. Two birds soar together, they wing into the sky,
They praise their Creator, oh, joy now sung on high;
Two waves rise together, swell, meet and surge as one,
Majestic, foam crashing, in strength go meet the sun.

2. Two roses grow together, a bloom upon one stem,
Pure fresh and lovely, they flower for all men;
Two rings linked together, a clasp that shall not part,
A bond to eternity, enclosing heart to heart.

3. Two stars spark together, with steady light they shine,
In faithfulness, hand holding, I'm thine, Thou art mine;
Two lamps burn together, the flames shall leap and rise,
A sign of light and truth, God's light that never dies.

4. Two hands clasp together, the grip is firm secure,
Our life is true unity, so strong and so sure;
Two hearts beat together, with love that conquers right
The love of two of many, the love of God's pure light.
