1. Most of my life I'd been filled with despair,
Everything seemed to slip by me;
'Bittered my heart and deserted my soul,
Then I drank at the well of mercy.

Chorus:
The waters of life give me strength to go on,
He opened my eyes, turned the darkness to dawn;
And now there is sunshine and love in my heart,
Something inside me is singing.
The thirst in my soul now is quenched every day
As I drink at the well of mercy.

2. Now if you are thirsty, come drink at this well,
You will never thirst again;
Like the woman at the well,
Jesus spoke to that day, Said,
'Come, drink at the well of mercy.'
