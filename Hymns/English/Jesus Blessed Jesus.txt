1. He made the lame to walk, he caused the blind to see;
He made the dumb to talk, he set the captive free;
He is the same today as yesterday,
He'll do the same for you, he is the same today.

Chorus:
Jesus, blessed Jesus,
He never faileth, his Word is true;
He'll hear your heart's cry; he'll answer you,
He is just the same today.

2. He heard Bartimaeus, he heard the leper's cry;
On road Emmaus, he did draw nigh;
He lifted burdens and all their cares,
He'll do the same for you, he is the same today.

3. Beside blue Galilee, he fed the multitude;
Rebuked the Pharisees and taught beatitudes;
In loving kindness unto all men,
He'll do the same for you, he is the same today.
