I was all alone and drifting on a lonely sea of sin.
Nothing but darkness, no sunshine within.
I lifted my eyes to the Lord in the sky.
And glory to God, He remembered me.

CH:Jesus remembered me.
And so He set me free.
Once I was blinded, but now I can see.
Glory to God, He remembered me.

Now the dawn is shining, I'm happy and free.
No more sorrows no troubles to see.
I'm going home to Glory, my Saviour to see.
Gory to God, He remembered me.

When He talked to His disciples on the Sea of Galilee
He said He'd remember a mortal like me.
I asked for His blessing down on my knees.
And glory to God, He remembered me.
