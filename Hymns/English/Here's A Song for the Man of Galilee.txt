1. Many songs today are written to deceive you.
There are many songs that talk about the way;
If you'll listen to this song you'll find the answer,
For Jesus is the Truth, the Life, the Way.

Chorus:
Here's a song for the man who walked the waters,
Here's a song for the man who calmed the sea;
Here's a song for the man who died for you and me,
Here's a song for the man from Galilee.

2. People stand in line to show who they believe in,
Then they march their heroes on to victory;
But today I'm gonna cast my vote for Jesus
For Jesus is all the world to me.
