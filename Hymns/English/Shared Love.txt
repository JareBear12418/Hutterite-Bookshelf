1. Dear Lord, now we stand at the altar,
Our hearts are at peace with thee;
Even though in some ways we feel like strangers
We share love's tranquility.

Chorus:
We share the same heavenly Father, (heavenly Father)
To thee we now humbly bow; (humbly bow)
We share the love you have given,
As we pledge this solemn vow.

2. You know us, Lord, from beginning,
You called us to be your own;
Our hearts you've prepared for this moment,
The seed of our love you have sown.

3. When we disappoint each other
Help us to be humble like thee;
To guard our love for each other,
Not our will but thine to be.
