1. He takes care of the helpless,
He gives strength to the weak;
He had saved my soul from dying,
He had set my spirit free.

Chorus:
Not to us, not to us,
But to Thy name, oh, glory be;
Not to us, not to us, Lord,
But to you eternally.

2. Some peoples idols are made of silver,
Some peoples idols are made of gold;
But my father's way up in heaven,
With treasures there untold.
