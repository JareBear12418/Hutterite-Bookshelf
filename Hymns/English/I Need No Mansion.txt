1. When burdens come too hard to bear
That no earthly friend can share
Tears drive away my smile and leave my heart in pain,
Then my Lord from Heaven above
Speaks to me in tones of love,
Wipes away the tears and makes me smile again.

Chorus: I need no mansion here below
For Jesus said that I could go
To a home beyond the clouds, not made by hand,
Won't you come and go along,
We will sing the sweetest song
Ever played upon the harps in glory land.

2. Oh, the thought to me is sweet,
That my loved ones I will meet
At the ending of my journey here below
Seems I hear their voices blend
In a world without an end
I won't worry when it's time for me to go.

3. When Jesus comes to claim His own,
I will move to my new home,
I'll walk and talk with Him upon the streets of gold
A mansion there is waiting me
Soon its beauty I shall see
In a city where we never shall grow old.
