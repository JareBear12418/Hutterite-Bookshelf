1. Move in our midst, Thou Spirit of God,
Go with us down from Thy holy hill;
Walk with us thro the storm and the calm,
Spirit of God, go Thou with us still.

2. Touch Thou our hands to lead us aright,
Guide us forever, show us Thy way;
Transform our darkness into Thy light
Spirit of God, lead Thou us today.

3. Strike from our feet the fetters that bind,
Lift from our lives, the weight of our wrong;
Teach us to love with heart, soul and mind,
Spirit of God, Thy love makes us strong.

4. Kindle our hearts to burn with Thy flame,
Raise up Thy banner high in this hour;
Stir us to build new worlds in Thy name
Spirit of God. oh send us Thy power.
