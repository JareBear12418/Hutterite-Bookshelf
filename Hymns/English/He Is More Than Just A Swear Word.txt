1. His name is voiced in every conversation,
He's now become a superstar they say;
But o the curse it's bringing to our nation,
As men forsake His holy name each day.

Chorus:
But He is more than just a swear word,
More than just an I don't care word
How can we use His name so recklessly
Our only hope is in this one word;
'Who so ever will may come word'
He's more than just a swear word,
He's the precious Son of God.

2. And it's hard to understand how those around us
Are plunging to a lost eternity;
And all the while they say the name of Jesus,
And curse the only name that sets men free.
