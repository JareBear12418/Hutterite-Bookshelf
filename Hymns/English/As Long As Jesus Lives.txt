1. As long as Jesus lives,
And strength to me He gives,
All fear and care from me depart,
And His love fills my heart.

2. He is my Shepherd, too,
Who leads His flock so true.
He pastures me where grass is green,
And dew from heaven I glean.

3. When shadows hide the sun,
And lions roaring come;
I know that still in darkness deep,
My Jesus watch will keep.

4. And if my foot should stray,
And this world's pain dismay,
I'd hasten then to Jesus' heart,
He'd make my pain depart.

5. I look to Him alone,
I long to be His own!
My Jesus loves me, that I know,
My joy does, overflow!
