1. Dear Lord, please make me happy,
And contented with my life,
For I know there's others far worse off than me,
There are some who lie in anguish
Their bodies wrecked in pain,
As for me I'm only blind and cannot see.

2. My little world is darkened,
There's sunshine in my heart,
There's sunshine I will spread while I remain;
And I know that up in heaven,
My sight will be restored,
Where there'll be no darkness, sorrow, grief nor pain.

3. I thank Thee for these two hands of mine,
I thank Thee for my voice,
I thank Thee for each blessing that I own;
And I thank Thee for Thy promise
When my life on earth is o'er,
I shall gladly sing and pray around Your throne.

4. I know the Bible tells me,
That You were here on earth,
And healed the sick and made the blind to see;
And I know that if I'm faithful,
And Your commandments keep,
Up in heaven You'll do the same for me.
