Chorus: There'll be joy for you
There'll be joy for me
In that city so bright and fair
There'll be joy for you There'll be joy for me
When we meet Him over there

1. When we lay each burden down
We'll put on our robe and crown
We will shout on the other shore
I'm gonna take my Savior's hand
Over in the promised land
There'll be joy, peace and love forevermore
(repeat chorus)

2. We shall walk the streets of gold
When the beauty we behold
When we hear Him say well done
We'll be happy in our home
And around the shining throne
There'll be light that will outshine the sun
(repeat chorus)
