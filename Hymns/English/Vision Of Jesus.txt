1. As I travel along on this Pilgrim way,
There are heartaches and burdens to bear;
But a vision of Jesus in heaven above
Our cross is much lighter to bear.

Chorus:
Don't lose your vision of Jesus,
Keep your eyes looking only on Him;
Many friends and dear loved ones, have lost their way.
They have lost their vision of Him.

2. I remember the time, I remember the place,
When Jesus so sweetly came in;
How he took all my burdens I carried so long,
When I first saw the vision of Him.

3. Now Jesus will come and He'll take us all home,
To a beautiful mansion so fair;
But if you're not ready He'll leave you behind.
You'll reap in this life what you sow.
