Thru shadows and valleys He'll keep you aright.

He'd like you to lay burdens down.
Trust in His care He knows Satan's wiles.
The end of long miles He'll win you a crown.

Resist old Satan, he will flee.
Trust Him, your future, your steps will be sure.
Walk careful, and pray'rful, to the end endure.
