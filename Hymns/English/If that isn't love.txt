1. He left the splendor of heaven
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely hill of Golgotha
There to lay down His life for me.

Chorus: If that isn't love the ocean is dry
There's no star in the sky
And the sparrow can't fly
If that isn't love, then heaven's a myth
There's no feeling like this
If that isn't love,

2. Even in death He remembered
The thief hanging by His side
He spoke with love and compassion
Then He took him to paradise.
