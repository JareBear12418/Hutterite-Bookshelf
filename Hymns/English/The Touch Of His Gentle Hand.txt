1. No matter how dark the night,
Or bitter the winds that blow;
One touch of the Master's gentle hand
And I am ready to go.
I'll go anywhere with him,
Through tempest or sinking sand,
As long as I feel the tender touch:
The touch of his gentle hand.

Chorus:
One touch of his gentle hand
Means more than the world to me,
One touch of his gentle hand
Will make every shadow meet.
I'll not be afraid to go
And bravely take my stand;
With courage and zeal, as long as I feel
The touch of his gentle hand.

2. The touch of his gentle hand
Can strengthen the faintest heart;
The touch of his tender hand divine
New, opened love can impart;
And so in his name I'll go,
And whether on sea or land,
I never shall fail if I can feel
The touch of his gentle hand.

3. Wherever I chance to be,
Wherever my feet may roam
I'll trust in the Lord's unchanging hand
To lead me all the way home;
And ever my prayer shall be,
Till safely at home I'll stand:
That I can feel his touch so real,
The touch of his gentle hand.
