1. Just as the sunrise upon a clear spring day,
Brings forth the beauty that the nighttime puts away.
So comes that morning when God shall be the light,
That makes the glory of that city shine so bright.

Chorus: Oh, sweetest heaven, I'm longing to be there,
Where Jesus dwells among the purest and the fair.
For in that city I'll evermore be free,
And walk those golden streets for all eternity.

2. Just as the sunrise brings forth a day that's new,
And all the colors then break forth in brightest hue.
So God will brighten a day that soon shall be,
And then we'll see what in the night we could not see.

3. That heavenly sunlight will never fade away,
Where all the angels know no ending of the day.
And there forever we'll know a joy that's new,
And our dear Savior's face will always be in view.
