1. Seek ye first the Kingdom of God
And His righteousness;
And all these things shall be added unto you,
Hallelu, Hallelujah.

Chorus:
Hallelujah, Hallelu,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

2. Ask and it shall be given unto you,
Seek and ye shall find;
Knock and the door shall be opened unto you,
Hallelu. Hallelujah.

3. Man does not live by bread alone,
But by every word;
That proceeds from the mouth of God,
Hallelu, Hallelujah.
