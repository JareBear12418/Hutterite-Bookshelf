Lord, take control of all my time, show me to live Your will, not mine.
So many times I go my way, in things I do and think and say.' CH:I know my character needs to change
Take my life and rearrange.
Trim off the branches that are sore.
Keep knocking on my conscience-door.' Yes, keep on knocking till I hear; until I feel and see You near.
When You are in, light up the night, and help me keep me out of evil's might.' My eyes they need to see Your way, or I'll get lost and go astray.
I need Your help here in this world, Lord, even when I'm growing old.

Lord, help me think of other souls; those who are roaming in the cold.
If there is something I can do, Lord, help me lead them on to You.
