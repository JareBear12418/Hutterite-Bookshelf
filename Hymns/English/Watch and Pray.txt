1. Watch and pray that when the Master cometh,
If at morning, noon, or night,
He may find a lamp in every window,
Trimmed, and burning clear and bright.

Refrain:
Watch and pray, the Lord commandeth;
Watch and pray, 'twill not be long.
Soon He'll gather home His loved ones,
To the happy vale of song.

2. Watch and pray; the tempter may be near us;
Keep the heart with jealous care,
Lest the door, a moment left unguarded,
Evil thoughts may enter there.

3. Watch and pray, nor let us ever weary;
Jesus watched and prayed alone;
Prayed for us when only stars beheld Him,
While on Olive's brow they shone.

4. Watch and pray, nor leave our post of duty,
Till we hear the Bridegroom's voice;
Then with Him the marriage feast partaking,
We shall evermore rejoice.
