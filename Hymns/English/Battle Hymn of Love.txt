1. I will pledge my heart to the love we share
Through the good and the bad times too
I'Â­ll forsake my rest for your happiness
'Til my death I will stand by you.

2. With God as my witness, this vow I will make
To have and to hold you, no other will take
For rich or for poor, under skies gray or blue
'Till my death I will stand by you.

3. There are wars and there are rumors of wars yet to come
Temptations we'll have to run through
Though others may tremble, I will not run
'Til my death I will stand by you.

4. I will put on the armor of faithfulness
To fight for a heart that is true
'Til the battle is won, I will not run
'Til my death I will stand by you.

5. With God as my witness, this vow I will make
To have and to hold you, no other will take
For rich or for poor, under skies gray or blue
'Til my death I will stand by you.
