1. I am resolved no longer to linger,
Charmed by the world's delight;
Things that are higher, things that are nobler,
These have allured my sight.

Chorus:
I will hasten to Him,
(I will hasten, hasten to Him,)
Hasten so glad and free, (hasten glad and free,)
Je - sus, greatest, highest,
(Jesus, Jesus,)
I will come to Thee.

2. I am resolved to go to the Savior,
Leaving my sin and strife;
He is the true One, He is the just One,
He hath the words of life.

3. I am resolved to follow the Savior,
Faithful and true each day,
Heed what He sayeth, do what He willeth,
He is the living way.

4. I am resolved to enter the kingdom,
Leaving the paths of sin,
Friends may oppose me, foes may beset me,
Still will I enter in.

5. I am resolved, and who will go with me?
Come, friends, without delay,
Taught by the Bible, led by the Spirit,
We'll walk the heav'nly way
