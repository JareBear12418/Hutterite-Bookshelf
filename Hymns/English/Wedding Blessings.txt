1. As life of wedded joy and blessing
Begins this day within our heart,
And would you always be possessing
The gift of love our Lord imparts,
Then shall indeed your love be great
Love which will never fluctuate:

2. As I have loved you, love each other
Spoke Christ our Lord unto His own,
So should we live for one another
And not unto ourselves alone.
:Love born of God is love indeed
Such love can conquer every need:

3. With such a glorious love possessing
Hearts knit together onto Christ,
Come joys and bliss of lasting blessing
Such in this heavenly gift unpriced,
:May Christ the Lord bless you, we pray
With love divine this wedding day:
