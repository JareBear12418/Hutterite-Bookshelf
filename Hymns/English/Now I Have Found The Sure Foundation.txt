1. Who thinks a moment that my heart can break,
Nobody, Lord, nobody at all;
Who prays about me as soon as they wake,
Nobody, Lord, nobody at all.

Chorus:
God sees the sparrows that falls to the ground,
You are the only one, Lord, who cares;
Tho' friends forsake me, your blessings I've found,
I know you care, Lord, I know you care.

2. Who knows the sorrow of many long miles,
Nobody, Lord, nobody at all;
Who wants the brightness to stay in my smile,
Nobody, Lord, nobody at all.

3. Who knows the feelings that cover my heart,
Nobody, Lord, nobody at all;
Who sees the teardrop when time comes to part,
Nobody, Lord, nobody at all.
