1. As a child my mama taught me about a man who lived for me
She said His name was Jesus and He died to set men free
She said there were some cruel ones,
who nailed His hands and feet
To a wooden cross on a hill known as Calvary.

2. With my eyes open wide I listened,
to the things my mom described
A crown of thorns upon His head,
and a spear that pierced His side
When she finished all her stories, I looked into her eyes
With lots of confusion and sadness I asked,
Mom, did He ever cry.

Chorus: Through the eyes of a child things are simple
God has given them the vision we all need
Through the eyes of a child the world seems brighter
And there wouldn't be such cruelty If we could see
through the eyes of a Child

3. Since I have grown in spirit, I think of how life used to be
When as a Child I thought this world
was everything it seemed
But all the world's confusion
there's still one thing I can believe
With the scars in His hands binding me
Like a Child my eyes could see
(Repeat Chorus)
