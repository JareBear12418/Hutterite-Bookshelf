Chorus: I'm the reason that He went to Calvary.
I'm the reason for the old rugged cross.
I'm the one who went astray,
I'm the one who found His way,
I'm the reason He died there that day.
1.
I'm the beggar that stood by the wayside;
I'm the blind man who fell by the way.
I'm the leper who cried out for mercy;
I'm the reason He died there that day.

2. I'm the lonely in need of a Savior;
I'm the lame man who sat by the gate;
I've been touched by the hand of Jesus.
I'm the reason He died there that day.

3. Are you lost, without someone to save you?
Have you wondered why Christians have joy?
Won't you come to the fountain for mercy?
You're the reason He died there that day.
