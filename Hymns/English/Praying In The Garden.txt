1. One night while praying in the garden,
With a sweet smell of roses all around;
I could feel the presence of Jesus,
When I called on the name of the Lord.

Chorus:
How I long for the day when I shall see Him,
In a place where the angels sweetly sing;
And I know I will never have to leave Him,
That forever more He'll be my king.

2. Our Father who art up in heaven,
I'm so weak, I know, but you're so strong;
Help me to become a better servant,
And He said, 'Go and praise my name in song.'

3. My Savior now is up in heaven,
At the right hand of my Father's throne;
Soon He'll be coming back again.
To receive His chosen children home.
