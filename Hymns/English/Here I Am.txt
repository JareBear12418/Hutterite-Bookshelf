1. On that resurrection morning,
When the redeemed are gathering in.
I'll be in that royal number,
When they call my name.
When they all join in and sing,
'Hallelujah to the King!'
I'll cry with a joyful sound,
'Lord, here I am.'

Chorus: Here I am, here I am,
I'm the one the shepherd left the fold and found;
There were ninety and nine,
But He left them just to find,
One little lost lamb and here I am.

2. When old Gabriel blows the trumpet,
And we rise up in the air.
In less time than a split second,
We'll be changed from here to there.
Where there'll be no grief or pain,
Perfect peace and joy shall reign;
Home at last I shall proclaim,
'Lord, here I am.'
