1. More like Thee, O Savior, let me be,
More like Thee from day to day;
Never let me from Thy footsteps stray,
Keep me in the narrow way.

Chorus:
More like Thee, More like Thee,
(Yes, More like Thee, Yes, More like Thee,)
More like Thee, O Christ, like Thee;
By Thy grace, O let me day by day
Grow more and more like Thee.

2. More like Thee, O Savior, let me be,
Pure without, and pure within;
Keep me ever from the ways of sin,
I the crown of life would win.

3. More like Thee, O Savior, let me be,
All my pilgrim journey thro';
Meek and lowly, ever kind and true,
Like Thyself in all I do
