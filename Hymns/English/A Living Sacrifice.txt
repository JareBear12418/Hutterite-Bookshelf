1. I love the Christ, the Son of God,
Who died that I might live;
I would my gratitude express,
A gift unto Him give.

Refrain:
My gift is small, it is my all,
Accept it, Lord, I pray;
Let self be slain, let Jesus reign
Within my heart alway.

2. I fail to find a sacrifice,
Or fitting gift to bring;
Earth's treasures have too little worth
To offer to my King.

3. No gift, however grand or great,
Could pay the debt I owe;
I bring myself, my life, my all,
A living gift bestow.

4. My members all I gladly yield
For service, Lord, to Thee;
To bear the blessed gospel light,
That others Christ may see.
