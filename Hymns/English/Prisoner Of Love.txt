1. When I came to Jesus,
I settled it all, I gave Him my life to control;
Neither fear nor persuasion, could draw me to Christ,
But His love has captured my soul.

Chorus:
I'm a prisoner of love '¦'¦'¦
A slave to the master,
I willing toil '¦'¦'¦'¦'¦'¦
Through the heat and the cold;
I seek no reward in this world below,
But when payday will come when the pearly gates unfold.

2. He holds me secure, in His love strong and true,
I'm happy His servant to be;
In bondage to Jesus forever I'll stay,
My soul doesn't want to be free.
