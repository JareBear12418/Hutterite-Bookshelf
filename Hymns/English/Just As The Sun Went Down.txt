1. Love like this was never known,
Though you've searched the whole world round;
Jesus dying for His own,
Just as the sun went down.

Chorus:
Just as the evening sun,
(Just as the evening sun, Just as the evening sun,)
Was sinking in the golden West,
Hanging between two thieves,
(Hanging between two thieves, Hanging between two thieves,)
They crucified the Son of God, (Son of God,)
Mocked by the multitude,
(Mocked by the multitude, Mocked by the multitude,)
They placed on Him a thorny crown,
L - o - v - e (Love like this was never known,)
L - o - v - e (Jesus dying for His own,)
Just as the sun went down.

2. In Sanhedrin He was tried,
Have no use for Him they cried;
By the mob He was crucified,
Just as the sun went down.
