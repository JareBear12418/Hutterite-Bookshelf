1. When I consider the words of my God,
The moon and the stars, and the path that He's trod;
The sheep and the oxen, the beans and the peas,
All of these wonders, makes me know that He's real.

Chorus:
How great is my God, how great is His word?
He's the greatest name that ever was heard;
He rolled back the waters, of the rugged Red Sea,
And said, 'I'm gonna lead you, if you trust in Me.'

2. He brought little Moses out of Pharaoh's hand
Just to lead His people, out of Egypt's land;
He locked the jaws of a lion one day
And thought of old Daniel who truly did pray.
