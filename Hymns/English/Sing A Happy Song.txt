1. The songbird sings so early in the morning,
For they know the sun's gonna shine;
I can sing for a miracle has happened
I am saved and Christ is mine.

Chorus:
I was born to sing a happy song,
I was born to sing a happy song,
Whether things go right,
Whether things go wrong,
I was born to sing a happy song.

2. I used to sing the sad song of sinners,
Till I found a new way to live;
I can sing, for with God I'm a winner
I have found the joy He gives.

3. It won't be long till I'll be a leavin'
To my home beyond the sky,
I know for sure there'll be no griefin',
There'll be shoutin' on the other side.
