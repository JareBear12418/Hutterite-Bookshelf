1. Lord Jesus, who didst once appear,
To grace a marriage feast:
We now beseech Thy presence here,
To make this wedding blest.
With grace the bride and bridegroom speed;
Thy love their pattern be:
May heart with heart be true indeed,
As knit, O Lord, in Thee.

2. In purest love their souls unite,
That they with Christ-like care,
May make each other's burden light,
By taking mutual share.
And looking to their heav'nly home,
Oh, may they dwell each day,
As heirs of life, till Thou shalt come,
To take Thy bride away.
