1. I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee.

Chorus:
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

2. Thru this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

3. When my feeble life is o'er,
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To thy Kingdom shore, to thy shore.
