Chorus:
Oh, Lord, I'll sing
(Yes, Oh, Lord, I'll sing)
These songs of praise to Thee,
(praise to Thee,)
For the life you gave at Calvary,
Broke the bonds of sin for me,
(sin for me,)
These rocks and stones that fly about,
Shall not cry out for me
(cry for me)
Cause, Lord, I'll sing
(Yes, I'll sing)
These songs of praise to Thee.

1. I'll sing blest Rock of Ages,
There's Power in the Blood of the Lamb,
O Victory in Jesus,
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound;
He's the Rock of my Salvation,
I'm Going Home and it Won't Be Long,
Lord, I'll praise your name forever
In the lyrics of these songs.
