1. There's coming up a Judgment Day.
It's coming before long;
We'll have no chance to say a word,
Our conscience will show alone.

2. And when before the Lord we'll stand,
And look with downcast eyes;
He'll surely know the wrong from right,
Also the truth from lies.

3. We can't do wrong and yet get by,
For sure He sees it all;
We'll all feel weak and shaky then,
When we will hear His call.

4. For sure we do not think enough,
Of this great Judgment Day;
All that we do and all we think,
Forever we won't stay.

5. It all depends the way we live,
God will be sorting us;
We must show something in our deeds,
It all depends on us.

6. There will be no excuses then,
When this day will appear;
And then God will read all our hearts,
When He'll be very near.

7. Do no good deeds for praise of men,
Do everything for God;
And His true eyes will see us then,
Reward we'll get from God.

8. This world is not our home we know,
Confess your sins today;
Before that Judgment Day will come,
'Cause then it is too late.

9. And we should love our neighbors true
Exactly as ourself;
And then we must forgive them, too,
Then God'll forgive us too.

10. If we won't do as we are told,
We will regret someday;
And then we'll wish we've done the right,
When we will get our pay.

11. It will be as He promised it,
His words they are so true;
And when we'll meet in Heaven there,
Then He'll be there with you.

12. Oh! all dear souls let's try our best,
Yet better than we've done;
And even if we try our best,
There'll still be missing some.
