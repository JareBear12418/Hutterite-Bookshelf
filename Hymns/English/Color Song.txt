1. Red is the color of the blood that flowed,
Down the face of someone who loved us so.
He's the perfect man; He's the Lord's own Son,
He's the Lamb of God, He's the only one:
That can give us life that can make us grow,
That can make the love between us flow.

2. Blue is the color of a heart so cold,
That will not bend when the story's told:
Of the love of God for a sinful race,
Of the blood that flowed down Jesus' face.
That can give us life, that can make us grow,
That can keep our hearts from growing cold.

3. Gold is the color of the morning sun,
That shines so freely on everyone.
It's the sun above that keeps us warm,
It's the Son of God that calms the storm;
That can give us life that can make us grow,
That can turn our mornings into gold.

4. Brown is the color of the autumn leaves,
When the winter comes to the barren trees.
There is birth, there is death, there is a plan,
And there is just one God, and there is just one Man:
That can give us life, that can make us grow,
That can make our sins as white as snow.
