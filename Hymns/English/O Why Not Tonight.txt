1. O do not let the word depart,
And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not your heart,
Be saved, O tonight.

Chorus:
O why (not tonight?) not tonight? (why not tonight?)
O why (not tonight?) not tonight? (why not tonight?)
Wilt thou (be saved?) be saved? (wilt thou be saved?)
Then why (not) not tonight? (why not tonight?)

2. Tomorrow's sun may never rise
To bless thy long deluded sight;
This is the time, O then, be wise,
Be saved, O tonight.

3. Our Lord in pity lingers still,
And wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at once thy stubborn will,
Be saved, O tonight.

4. Our blessed Lord refuses none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Believe, obey, the work is done,
Be saved, O tonight.
