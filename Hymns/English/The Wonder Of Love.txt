1. There's something I know, I plainly can see,
So gently it comes and it settles on me.
God made it in heaven, it comes from above,
A beautiful something, the wonder of love.

Chorus: The wonder of love to me is made known,
(The won - der of love made known)
God's mercy and pardon so freely are shown,
(God's mer - cyso free - ly shown)
Like rays of warm sunshine it comes from above;
(Like raysofthe sun from above)
It touches me now, oh the wonder of love.
(It touches me now, oh the wonder of love, God's love)

2. It stirs in my heart and it makes my life glow,
Gives meaning to life as onward I go.
It brings hearts together that once were apart,
This miracle wonder of love in my heart.

3. It touches my heart, its warmth I can feel;
It shines on my path I see it is real.
It's cause for great changes for miracles wrought,
This God given wonder of love in my heart.
