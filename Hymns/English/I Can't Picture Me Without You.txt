1. Like the grass lying still,
'Neath the flowers on the hill,
Without you, Lord, they just wouldn't grow;
Like a lost sheep astray,
I'd be wandering each day,
Without you I'd have no place to go.

Chorus:
I can vision a tree with no branches,
I can vision a church with no pew;
I can vision a well with no water,
But, Lord, I can't picture me without you.

2. Precious Lord, be my guide,
Ever walking by my side,
When I'm weak give me strength to go on;
In the darkness of night,
Hold my hand, be my light,
Guide my steps till I'm safely at home.
