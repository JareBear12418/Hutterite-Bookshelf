1. There once lived a man who worked all his life,
To build a great empire he had.
Then one fatal night on his deathbed he lay,
And these were the last words he said:

2. 'What good is my great reputation,
All the treasures I have on this earth?
For tonight God's death angels are calling,
And I wonder how much am I worth?'

3. Some folks I have known, left their families and home,
In search of more silver and gold.
But someday they'll find, all the gold in the world
Is not worth one heartbeat of love.

4. What good is your fame and your fortune,
All the treasures you have on this earth;
When you're growing old and you're lonely,
Then I wonder how much are you worth.

5. Now friends, don't be lured by temptations and sin,
The wages of sin are too high;
When your time has come and they're digging your grave,
Not one grain of dirt can you buy.
