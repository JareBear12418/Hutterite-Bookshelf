1. There's a city that looks over the valley of death,
And it's glory has never been told;
Where the lamb gives the light, in the midst of the night,
In that beautiful city of gold.

Chorus:
Where the sun (Where the sun) never sets, (never sets,)
And the leaves (And the leaves) never fade; (never fade;)
And the righteous forever will shine like the stars,
In that beautiful city of gold.

2. There will be no more sorrow, pain, sickness or death,
And the saints, they will never grow old;
How I long for that day, where there never comes the night,
In that beautiful city of gold.
