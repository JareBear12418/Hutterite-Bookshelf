1. Oh Lord, may I lean a bit harder
And press a bit closer to thee?
I'm feeling the pressure of trials
From riding the storm driven sea.
The winds of adversity gather,
Compelling me into thy arms,
Then Lord, may I lean a bit harder,
Supported by thee in the storm?

Chorus: My child, I delight in thy leaning;
Lean harder, press closer to me.
The trials you face I've allowed them,
To help you lean harder on me.

2. Oh Lord, when I'm bleeding with sorrow
At losing a loved one so dear,
May I lean a bit harder, dear Jesus,
Lean harder than ever before?
I feel that you understand sorrow,
More fully than any I know,
And surely thy arms bring the healing
Which only thy love can bestow.

3. When time with its changes surround me
And brings with it greater demands,
I know I'm still in thy keeping
And holding thy strengthening hand.
But Lord, I am weak and dependent,
I'm needing a greater degree,
My heart cries in utter dependence,
'May I lean a bit harder on thee?'

4. I'm finding thy bosom a comfort,
A balm of new strength unto me,
The burdens of life become lighter
When leaning completely on thee.
Then Lord, I would ever be leaning
And drawing new strength is my plea,
Alone with thy precious communion,
'May I lean a bit harder on thee?'
