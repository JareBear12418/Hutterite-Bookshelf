1. Jesus Christ, the Lord, opened up the way to glory
When He died to save us from our ruined state,
And He asks that we shall go tell the world the story,
How His blood will save them from their awful fate.

Chorus:
Je - - sus opened up
(Jesus Christ the Lord opened up the way,)
The way to heaven's gate
(way to heaven's gate, opened up the way,)
When He died on the cross,
(When the Savior died, died upon the cross,)
To redeem all the lost;
(To redeem the lost, to redeem the lost;)
He prepared the road
(He prepared the road to His blest abode,)
That leads To His abode,
(Jesus made the road to His blest abode,)
Tis a road marked by blood
(Tis a road that's marked by the Savior's blood)
But it leads us home to God.
(But it safely to heav'n above.)

2. And the way is marked by the footprints of the Savior,
With His blood He made it, made it plain and straight;
If you walk that way, it will lead you into heaven,
Lead you safely into glory's golden gate.

3. Sinner, will you come and join in this heav'nly journey,
Walk the bloody pathway that the Savior trod;
Then when life is over and all the sheaves are garnered,
You will meet the Savior and be not afraid.
