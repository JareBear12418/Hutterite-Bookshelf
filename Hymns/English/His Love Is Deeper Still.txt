1. Sometimes the load I carry, seems more than I can take,
When I'm barely treading water, in a flood of deep heartache;
But all this pain and suffering, He promised we could meet;
'Cause when we're in over our head,
We're still beneath His feet.

Chorus: When I find myself sinking so deep, that I can't stand,
That's when He reaches deeper still
And holds me with His hand.
Sometimes the storms we go through,
Are somehow part of His will,
But thru the floods I have found:
His love is deeper still.

2. Now this is not the first time and it won't be the last,
But I know my God is faithful and soon the storm will pass.
It's thru these times of trial, I've learned His strength is real,
That's when He proves once again,
His love is deeper still.
