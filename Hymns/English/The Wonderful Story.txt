1. Oh, sweet is the story of Jesus,
The wonderful Savior of men,
Who suffered and died for the sinner
O I'll tell it again and again!

Chorus:
O won - - derful, wonderful sto - ry,
(O wonderful sto - ry, O wonderful story,)
The dear - est that ever was told;
(The dearest that ev - - er, that ever was told;)
I'll repeat it in glo - ry, the wonderful sto - ry,
(I'll repeat it in glory, the wonderful story,)
Where I shall His beauty behold.
(Where I shall His beau - - ty, His beauty behold.)

2. He came from the brightest of glory;
His blood as a ransom He gave,
To purchase eternal redemption,
And oh, He is mighty to save!

3. His mercy flows on like a river,
His love is unmeasured and free;
His grace is forever sufficient,
It reaches and purifies me.
