1. There is not a friend like Jesus
In the trying scenes of life,
He can hear the heart's faint whisper,
Calm the tempest's raging strife.

Chorus: There is not a friend like Jesus,
Patient, tender, kind and true;
If you'll be a friend to Jesus,
He will be a friend to you.

2. There is not a friend like Jesus;
Bid the scoffing world adieu;
But if you're ashamed of Jesus
He will be ashamed of you.

3. There is not a friend like Jesus;
Trust Him ev'rywhere you go;
He has trod the way before you,
Suffered ev'ry pain and woe.

4. There is not a friend like Jesus;
When you draw your life's last breath;
If you'll be His friend while living,
He will be your friend in death.

5. There is not a friend like Jesus;
What a blessed tho't, to be
Folded in His arms of power
Ever in eternity!
