1. O blessed hearts, who at the marriage altar
Have chosen Thee, O Lord, as Friend and Guide,
Who take Thy Hand, lest feeble steps should falter,
Who in Thy love and fellowship abide.
Who at Thy bosom rest in joy or sorrow,
Who flee to Thee in pleasure as in pain.
O happy hearts, who thus can greet each morrow,
Who walk through life with Thee as Lord and King.

2. Thou Lord, art present at this happy union,
Hast heard their pray'rs unto Thy Throne ascend.
Their hearts o'erflow this hour in sweet communion;
Be Thou their joy unto their journey's end.
Oh grant that they may share each happy moment,
And evermore each other's burden bear.
Be Thou their help until heav'n's portals open,
Where they at last eternal glories share.
