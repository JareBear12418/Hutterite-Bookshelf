1. Oh Lord, on the cross you died for me,
To pardon my sin and set me free.
Your mercy's so great and love so true;
My heart's desire is to know you.

Chorus:
That I may know him who gave his life for me,
My Abba, Father, my King fore'er will be;
That I may know him in whole, not in part;
This is the deepest desire of my heart.

2. My time is so short, the days are few,
My desires and my plans, Lord, I give to you.
To serve to the fullness my great King,
Lord, I am yours, you're my everything.

3. Any burden, any trial you give to me,
I know 'tis your will, Lord, let it be.
Give me grace, strength I'll need to toil and sow;
When life is o'er your joy I'll know.
