Life is like a mountain railroad
With an engineer that's brave.
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave.
Watch the curves, the fills, the tunnels;
Never falter, never quail,
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail.

Refrain:
Blessed Savior Thou wilt guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore.
Where the angels wait to join us
In thy praise forevermore.

You will roll up grades of trial
You will cross the bridge of strife.
See that Christ is your conductor
On this lightening train of life
Always mindful of obstruction;
Do your duty, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail.

You will often find obstructions.
Look for storms and wind and rain
On a fill or curve or trestle;
They will nearly ditch your train.
Put your trust alone in Jesus;
Never falter, never fail.
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail.

As you roll across the trestle
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You behold the union depot
Into which your train must glide
There you'll meet the Superintendent
God the Father, God the Son
With the hearty joyous 'plaud it
Weary pilgrim, welcome home.
