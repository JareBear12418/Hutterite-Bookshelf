1. Why did He go to Calvary?
What did He see in worthless me?
His precious life He gave,
My sinful soul to save.

Chorus:
When I was lost, He came and found me,
It's called mercy;
And from my guilt He then unbound me,
It's called pardon.
And when He sees the way I live,
And He can still say, 'I forgive';
There's only one way to define it,
There's no other way to say it,
There's only one way to describe it,
It's called love.

2. Oh what a peace I now enjoy,
My sinful past He did destroy;
He'll do the same for you
If you will ask Him, too.
