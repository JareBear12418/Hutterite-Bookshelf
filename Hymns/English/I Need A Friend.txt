1. When at times I feel that I'm alone unto myself,
That I can walk alone and need no help;
I kneel me down and pray to God above,
And then I know I need His love.

Chorus:
I need a friend to help me thru the darkness of the night,
A guiding hand, to keep walking in the light;
And when at last, I shall have reached my journey,
And I know that I, shall need a friend!

2. I think of all the days that I would like to have,
And envy those whose lives I'd like to live;
Then I'm reminded of the treasures that
I'll own when the Savior walks me home.
