1. If I have wounded any soul today,
If I have caused one foot to go astray,
If I have walked in my own willful way,
Dear Lord, forgive.

2. If I have uttered idle words or vain,
If I have turned aside from want or pain,
Lest I myself shall suffer through the strain,
Dear Lord, forgive.

3. If I have been perverse or hard or cold,
If I have longed for shelter in thy fold,
When thou hast given me some fort to hold,
Dear Lord, forgive.

4. Forgive the sins I have confessed to thee;
Forgive the secret sins I do not see;
O guide me, love me, and my keeper be,
Dear Lord, Amen.
