1. No matter how far in this world you have roamed
Or what sin has caused you to do;
There's always someone to help you along
For somebody's praying for you.

Chorus:
Praying for you, praying for you,
Somebody's praying for you
Your path may be dark and your friends may be few
But somebody's praying for you.

2. No matter what happens they still lift their eyes,
And all of your faults they'll rebuke;
Though loved ones forget you and friends pass you by,
But somebody's praying for you.

3. You find consolation in worldly affair,
But when it's all over you're blue;
And then you flee back to the mercy of God,
For somebody's praying for you.
