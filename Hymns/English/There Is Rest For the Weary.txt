1. In the Christian's home in glory
There remains a land of rest;
There my Savior's gone before me
To fulfill my soul's request.

Chorus:
There is rest for the weary, There is rest for the weary,
There is rest for the weary, There is rest for you;
On the other side of Jordan, In the sweet fields of Eden,
Where the tree of Life is blooming, There is rest for you.

2. He is fitting up my mansion,
Which eternally shall stand;
For my stay shall not be transient
In that holy happy land.

3. Pain and sickness ne'er shall enter,
Grief nor woe my lot shall share;
But, in that celestial center,
I a crown of life shall wear.

4. Death itself shall then be vanquished,
And his sting shall be withdrawn;
Shout for gladness, oh, ye ransomed!
Hail with joy the rising morn.
