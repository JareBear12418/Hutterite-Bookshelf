1. There's no disappointment in heaven,
No weariness, sorrow or pain;
No hearts there are bleeding and broken,
No song with minor refrain;
The clouds of our earthly horizon
Will never appear in the' sky,
For all will be sunshine and gladness,
With never a sob nor a sigh.

Chorus:
I'm bound for that beautiful city
My Lord has prepared for His own;
Where all the redeemed of all ages
Sing 'glory' around the white throne;
Sometimes I grow 'homesick' for heaven,
And the glories I there shall behold:
What a joy that will be when my Savior I see,
In that beautiful city of gold.

2. We'll never pay rent for our mansion,
The taxes will never come due;
Our garments will never grow threadbare,
But always be fadeless and new;
We'll never be hungry nor thirsty,
Nor languish in poverty there,
For all the rich bounties of heaven
His sanctified children will share.

3. There'll never be crape on the doorknob,
No funeral train in the sky;
No graves on the hillsides of glory,
For there we shall never more die.
The old will be young there forever,
Transformed in a moment of time;
Immortal we'll stand in His likeness,
The stars and the sun to outshine.
