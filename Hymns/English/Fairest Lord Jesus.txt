1. Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature,
O thou of God and man the Son;
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor,
Thou, my soul's glory, joy and crown.

2. Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,
Robed in the blooming garb of spring;
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

3. Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight,
And all the twinkling, starry host;
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
Than all the angels heav'n can boast.

4. Fair are the meadows, fair still the woodlands,
When springtime comes in beauty clad;
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,
Who grieving hearts with joy makes glad.
