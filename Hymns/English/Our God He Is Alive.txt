1. There is beyond the azure blue,
A God concealed from human sight;
He tinted skies with heavenly hue,
And framed the world with His great might.

Chorus: There is a God, (There is a God)
He is alive, (He is alive)
In Him we live, (In Him we live)
And we survive. (And we survive)
From dust our God (From dust our God)
Created man, (Created man)
He is our God, (He is our God)
The great I Am. (The great I Am)

2. There was a long, long time ago,
A God whose voice the prophets heard.
He is the God that we should know,
Who speaks from His inspired Word.

3. Secure is life from mortal mind,
God holds the germ within His hand.
Though men may search they cannot find,
For God alone does understand.

4. Our God whose Son upon a tree,
A life was willing there to give.
That He from sin might set man free,
And ever more with Him could live.
