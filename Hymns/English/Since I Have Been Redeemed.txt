1. I have a song I love to sing,
Since I have been redeemed,
Of my Redeemer, Savior, King,
Since I have been redeemed.

Chorus:
Since I have been redeemed,
(Since I have been redeemed, Since I have been redeemed,)
Since I have been redeemed,
I will glory to His name;
Since I have been redeemed,
(Since I have been redeemed, Since I have been redeemed,)
Since I have been redeemed,
I will glory in my Savior's name.

2. I have a Christ that satisfies,
Since I have been redeemed,
To do His will my highest prize,
Since I have been redeemed.

3. I have a witness bright and clear,
Since I have been redeemed,
Dispelling ev'ry doubt and fear,
Since I have been redeemed.

4. I have a home prepared for me,
Since I have been redeemed,
Where I shall dwell eternally,
Since I have been redeemed.
