1. It's because Jesus loves us that we wash each others feet,
It's 'cause Jesus was a Servant, that to serve Him is our meat;
When we prefer one another, we don't do it on our own,
It's because of the blood of Jesus it's His table that I wait.

2. Working so hard just to get the housework done,
We don't often get outside to see the sun;
All God's children seem to have so much to do,
For the harvest's great, but the labors are few.

3. It's because Jesus loves us that we sit around and talk,
It's 'cause we got Christ in common, I pick up your dirty socks;
It's not because I love the dishes, that I labor at the sink,
It's because of the blood of Jesus, it's His table that I wait.

4. Working so hard in the wind and rain and sun,
From the break of day until the day is done;
All God's children seem to have so much to do,
For the harvest's great, but the labors are few.

5. It's because Jesus loves us, you're a flower in my sight,
It's because of the Rose of Sharon I come home to you at night;
It's not because I love the farmwork, that I labor in the field,
It's because of the blood of Jesus, it's His table that I wait.
