1. The joy of the Lord is our strength of His people
The sunshine that banishes sorrow and gloom;
The fountain that bursts in the desert of sorrow,
And sheds o'er the wilderness gladness and bloom.

Chorus:
The joy of the Lord is our strength and our song,
Our sorrow and sighing are o'er;
We'll rejoice in the Lord, we'll rejoice in the Lord,
We'll rejoice in the Lord evermore.

2. The joy of the Lord is our strength for life burdens
And gives to each duty a heavenly zest;
It sets to sweet music the task of the toiler
And softens the couch of the laborers rest.

3. The joy of the Lord is our strength for life's trials,
And lifts the sad heart above sorrow and care;
Like the nightingales notes it can sing in the darkness,
And rejoice when the fig tree is fruitless and bare.

4. The joy of the Lord is the hope of our calling,
And oh, for His coming how fondly we pray;
When we shall return with rejoicing to Zion,
And sorrow and sighing shall vanish away.
