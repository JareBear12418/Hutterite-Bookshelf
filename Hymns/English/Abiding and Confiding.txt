I have learned the wondrous secret
Of abiding in the Lord;
I have found the strength and sweetness
Of confiding in His word;
I have tasted life's pure fountain,
I am drinking of His blood,
I have lost myself in Jesus,
I am sinking into God.
Refrain:
I'm abiding in the Lord,
And confiding in His word,
And I'm hiding, safely hiding,
In the bosom of His love.
I am crucified with Jesus,
And He lives and dwells in me,
I have ceased from all my struggling,
'Tis no longer I but He;
All my will is yielded to Him,
And His Spirit reigns within,
And His precious blood each moment
Keeps me cleansed and free from sin.
All my cares I cast upon Him,
And He bears them all away;
All my fears and griefs I tell Him,
All my needs from day to day.
All my strength I draw from Jesus,
By His breath I live and move;
E'en His very mind He gives me
And His faith and life and love.
For my words I take His wisdom,
For my works His Spirit's pow'r,
For my ways His gracious presence
Guards and guides me every hour;
Of my heart He is the Portion,
Of my joy the ceaseless Spring,
Savior, Sanctifier, Keeper,
Glorious Lord and loving King.
