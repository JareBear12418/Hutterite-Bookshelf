1. Have you read the story of the cross
Where Jesus bled and died;
Where your debt was paid by the precious blood,
That flowed from His wounded side?

Chorus: He died of a broken heart for you;
He died of a broken heart.
O wondrous love! for you, for me;
He died of a broken heart.

2. Have you read how they placed the crown of thorns
Upon His lowly brow?
When He prayed, 'Forgive them, oh! forgive;
They know not what they do.'

3. Have you read that He saved the dying thief
When hanging on the tree?
Who looked with pleading eyes and said,
'Dear Lord, remember me.'

4. Have you read that He looked to heav'n and said,
' Tis finished, 'twas for thee?'
Have you ever said, 'I thank thee, Lord,
For giving thy life for me?'
