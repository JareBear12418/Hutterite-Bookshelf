1. Troublesome waters are blacker than night,
Hiding from view the harbor light bright;
Out on the ocean, I've seen as aspect,
Awful sea monsters are waiting my rest.

Chorus:
Gently I feel the touch of His hand
(Gently I feel the touch of His hand)
Guiding my boat to that better land;
(Guiding my boat to that better land;)
Leading the way to heaven's bright shore,
(Leading the way to heaven's bright shore,)
Troublesome waters, I'm fearing no more.
(Troublesome waters I'm fearing no more)

2. Sin waves are tossing and dashing so high,
Over the noise you hear my sad cry;
Lord, I'm trusting, show mercy to me,
Steady my lifeboat while I am at sea
