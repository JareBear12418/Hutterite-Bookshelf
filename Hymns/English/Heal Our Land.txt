(2. Chron. 7:14) 1.
1. Forgive us, Lord, and heal our land;
And give us eyes to seek your face, and hearts to understand
That you, alone, make all things new;
And the blessings of the land we love
Are really gifts from you.

Chorus: If my people will humbly pray,
And seek my face and turn away
From all their wicked ways;
Then I will hear them and move my hand,
And freely then will I forgive,
And I will heal their land.

2. Unite our hearts in one accord,
And make us hungry for your peace,
And burdened for the poor;
And grant us, Lord, that we might see
A future for the land we love, our life, our liberty.
