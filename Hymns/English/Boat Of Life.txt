1. My friend is the going rough with troubles seas around?
Do angry winds beset your soul and dark clouds on you frown?
Have you ever looked for bread and only found a stone?
Could it be 'cause you paddle in your Boat of Life alone?

2. Is the route you once have charted, now both blurred and marred,
Is your soul and body weary, the task of rowing hard?
Have you ever looked for joy and disappointment known?
Could it be 'cause you paddle in your Boat of Life alone?

3. My friend there is one who knows your every fault and sin,
And He knows your struggling hand you row your Life Boat in;
So why not call on Jesus, He'll help you simply on,
Oh my friend, it's foolish to paddle all alone.
