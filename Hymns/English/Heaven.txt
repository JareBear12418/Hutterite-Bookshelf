1. In childhood I heard of a heaven,
I wondered if it could be true,
That sacred, sweet minds of eternal,
Somewhere up far beyond the blue;
I wondered if people really go there,
Then one day sweet Jesus came in,
Then I got a vision of Heaven,
My soul toward heaven I send.

Chorus:
Heaven (that home above,) Heaven (that Jesus loves)
O it makes me feel like traveling on;
Heaven (supernal) Heaven (eternal)
I'm so glad its real.

2. Then I got a vision of Heaven
My soul is o'erflowing with love,
My heart like the Savior's is broken,
For the friends that will miss that home above.
Then a voice from the hills of Judea,
Still ringing with the sweet relief,
For worldly attraction don't thrill me,
My soul has a change of relief.
