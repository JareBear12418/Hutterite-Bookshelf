(Psalm 121)

1. I lift my eyes up To the mountains,
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from you
Maker of heaven, Creator of the earth.

2. Oh, how I need you, Lord!
You are my only hope,
You're my only prayer;
So I will wait for you
To come and rescue me,
Come and give me life.
(repeat all)
