1. Oh Lord, I know that we are one in thee,
And I know a price for reality,
So make it real, make it real,
Make it real unto me,
That I might move corporately.

2. I know thy law and thy Word
And I could do it outwardly,
But I know I would be,
Just another Pharisee;
So make it real, make it real,
From within me.
