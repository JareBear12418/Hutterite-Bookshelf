1. Careless soul, why will you linger,
Wandering from the fold of God?
Hear you not the invitation?
O prepare to meet thy God.

Chorus:
Careless soul oh heed the warning
(Oh careless soul oh heed the warning, heed the warning)
For your life will soon be gone;
(Will soon be gone, oh yes, your life will soon be gone)
Oh how sad to face the Judgment
(To face the Judgment, oh how sad to face the Judgment)
Unprepared to meet thy God.
(Unprepared to meet thy God)

2. Hear you not the earnest pleadings
Of your friends that wish you well?
And perhaps before tomorrow
You'll be called to meet your God.

3. If you spurn the invitation
Till the spirit shall depart;
Then you'll see your bad condition
Unprepared to meet thy God.
