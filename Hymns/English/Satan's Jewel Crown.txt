1. If I could be king and ruler of nations,
Where diamonds and jewels were found;
I rather would know that I have salvation,
Than to know my reward is Satan's jewel crown.

Chorus:
Satan's jewel crown, I've worn it so long,
But God for my soul has reached down;
His love set me free, He made His own
And helped me cast out Satan's jewel crown.

2. When I lived my life so reckless and evil
Drinking and running around;
The things I would do were the will of the devil
I was giving my soul for Satan's jewel crown.
