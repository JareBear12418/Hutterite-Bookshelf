1. When I wake up in the morning,
My trials all begin anew;
You said nothing shall befall me,
But such as cometh from Thy hand.

Chorus:
Please, dear Jesus, take my hand now,
Help me, Lord, to understand;
You're not trying to just hurt me,
But you're proving that You care.

2. Leaning on Your gentle bosom,
What joy and peace shall rest in there;
I know Your promise will come true, Lord,
As I put my faith in You.
