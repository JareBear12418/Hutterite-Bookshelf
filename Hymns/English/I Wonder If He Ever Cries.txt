1. When I think how Jesus died,
And for my sins was crucified.
Oh, a love such as this, I just can't comprehend.
When I think how He must feel,
To have suffered through that ordeal.
Yet His love has been rejected
By so many through the years.

Chorus: I wonder if He ever cries,
When He thinks of how He bled and died?
Does the memory remain?
Can He still feel the pain
Of sin and shame He bore for me?
And every time He sees His scars,
Does it bring a tear into His eyes?
When many never serve Him,
Not caring how He loved them;
I wonder does it make Him cry?

2. When I think about the blood
That Jesus shed through love,
And all the pain that He suffered, in dying agony.
Yet in the midst of all this grief
He had mercy on one thief;
Who simply asked for mercy
And salvation he received.
