1. I had no one to blame,
How I longed to hide my face;
I was so ashamed,
Of all the wrong I'd done.
And I knew I had to pay,
I was bound to face hell's flames;
I'd be there today,
My friend, but for the blood.

Chorus: But for the blood, shed on Calvary's tree;
But for the blood, there'd be no hope for you and me.
For all my righteousness is filthy rags,
And that's all I'd ever be, but for the blood
That cleansed and set me free.

2. Even now I get so low,
And the devil lets me know
I'm so undeserving;
I'm unworthy of God's love,
And, oh yes, I know it's true;
But here I stand with the chosen few,
I stand today,
Yes, I'm saved just by the blood.
