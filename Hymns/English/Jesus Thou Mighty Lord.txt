1. Jesus, Thou mighty Lord,
Great is Thy name;
Still thro' eternal years,
Thou art the same;
Changeless Thy holy Word,
True evermore;
Thy name we glorify,
Thy name adore.

2. Jesus, Thou mighty Lord,
Jesus, our King,
Praise for Thy wondrous love
Gladly we sing.
Love in Thy diadem
Shines evermore;
Thy name we glorify,
Thy name adore.

3. Sought by Thy mercy, Lord
Saved by Thy pow'r,
Led by Thy gracious hand,
Kept ev'ry hour.
Thine shall the honor be,
Thine evermore;
Thy name we glorify,
Thy name adore.
