1. They're building great mansions,
But they're building on sand;
Their treasures are worthless
When before God they'll stand;
The rock called Salvation
Is Jesus alone,
So build on Him, brother
He cares for His own.

2. Yes, so many are searching
For treasure each day,
And don't take their time
To kneel down and pray;
They're walking and sinking
In quick sand of time,
No call of Salvation
Of God's love divine.
