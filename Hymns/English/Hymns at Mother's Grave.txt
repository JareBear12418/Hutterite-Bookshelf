1. When the cold winds thru the pines begin to call,
And the shadows seem across my path to fall;
Where I seem to loose the spirit of the brave
Then I sing the hymns they sang at mother's grave.

Chorus:
Oh, I love the hymns they sang at mother's grave,
And I'll always sing them on my darkest days;
It's the only thing I find, that can bring cheer,
To an orphan's life that is so sad and drear.

2. Oh, my father's heart was broken from that day,
With his head bowed low, I saw him walk away;
God in heaven only knows the times I've cried,
Since the hour that my darling mother died.
