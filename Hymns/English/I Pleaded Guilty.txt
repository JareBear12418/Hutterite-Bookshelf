1. Like a man on the run, I had gone the last mile,
Desperate surrender I gave up for trial.
The charges against me I could not deny,
If justice was given I'd be sentenced to die.

Chorus:
I stood before Jesus with the death penalty,
With love and compassion he looked down at me.
I asked for mercy, my heart filled with strife;
I pleaded guilty and he gave me life.

2. Like an inmate on death row, just waiting each day,
Eternal darkness a few steps away.
At the last moment with no hope in sight,
I asked for mercy and he gave me life.
