1. Let me go, let me go,
Lord to me thy presence show;
Thither still my heart is turning,
For thy heav'nly court is yearning,
There thy perfect rest to know:.:

2. Sweetest light, sweetest light,
Sun that scatt'rest clouds in flight;
O when shall I come before Thee,
When shall I with saints adore Thee?
Dwelling in thy presence bright:.:

3. Oh, how clear, oh, how clear,
Ring the angel's voices there;
While my soul for wings is sighing,
Wings o'er vale and mountain flying,
Now in Zion to appear:.:

4. What shall be, what shall be,
All the joys laid up for me;
Lord, I know not eyes are holden,
Till Jerusalem the golden,
In it's beauty I shall see:.:

5. Paradise, Paradise,
Fairest fruits delight our eyes;
Where the tree of life is planted,
Bliss beyond our dreams is granted,
Bring us, Lord, to Paradise:.:
