1. Now you can buy insurance plans
To pay you when you're ill,
And if your earthly home should burn
A new one you can build.
Insurance on your earthly wealth
Your silver and your gold,
But read God's book, don't overlook
Insurance on your soul.

Chorus:
Insured beyond the grave,
Protection on your soul,
When this old house you're living in
The hands of death will close;
Your policy may pay your friends
And cover you with clay,
What have you got if you are not
Insured beyond the grave?

2. The precious Savior stands and waits
And knocks upon your door,
He'll enter in and set you free,
From death forevermore;
The only fee you'll have to pay
Is humble words in prayer,
Give up this world and all its worth,
And be a millionaire.
