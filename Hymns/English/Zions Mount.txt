1. All they who put their trust in Jesus
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zions Mount
By many ages proved.

Chorus:
Like the Mount of God,
(Like the Mount the holy Mount of God,)
Like the Mount of God,
(Like the holy Mount of God, like the holy Mount of God,)
They stand secure like Zions Mount by many ages proved;
They can never be
(Never be removed can never be removed)
Removed Removed,
(Can never be removed can never be removed,)
They stand secure like Zions Mount
They can never be removed.

2. As round about Jerusalem
The rugged mountain lie,
So round about His holy saints
Our God is ever nigh.

3. Thus overshadow by His love
Where harm can never betide;
Within His refuge safe and sure I ever would abide.
