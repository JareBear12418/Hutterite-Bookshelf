1. You turn to face the morning,
you can feel the rain before you even go outside
Through a cloudy windowpane,
you're reminded of the way you feel inside
You cry God I can't go on, will thou never heal the wounds
I feel I can't hold on, another day

2. When a mountain of sorrow, eases a river of heartaches
In a valley of darkness, that you don't understand
Take the high road to heaven at the crossroad of Calvary
To the refuge of Jesus lay all in His hands - And let it go

3. You're the life in every crowd,
but inside you're an island in the sea
Hollow empty words fill the time but don't always fill the need
Jesus knows your pain, He'll go with you all the way
There's nowhere you go today, He hasn't been.
