1. On a quiet summer day
Long ago and far away;
A little girl was kneeling by a grave,
As I stood there by her side,
She was gazing at the sky,
Unto the Lord, these words I heard her say.

Chorus:
Oh, Lord, please tell me, do,
Why you took my mom with you?
Why on earth am I left all alone?
I loved her, didn't You see,
'Cause she was so good to me,
She always taught me what was right from wrong.

2. I remember her one day
When she taught me how to pray
And as for favor took me on her knees;
That's why I'm kneeling here,
My prayer, dear Lord, to hear,
So tell me, Lord, why mama went away.

3. Since mother has closed her eyes,
Every day, dear Lord, I cry;
For there's no one to care for me, you see,
Oh, the days they seem so long
When on earth you have no home.
So tell me, Lord, why mamma went away.
