1. My soul cries out in awesome wonder,
Viewing countless stars, only God can number.
How many million miles, up to the nearest star?
I feel so very small, how can I see so far?

Chorus: Almighty God, how great thou art;
You have no ending you have no start.
I know by faith you're real,
For your love I daily feel;
Almighty God, I believe in you.

2. My eyes look up to lofty mountains,
And I drink from cool refreshing fountains;
I see the flowers bloom in time of early spring,
All nature speaks your name, the God of everything.

3. Great God so high, so kind and holy,
Bending way down low, so meek and lowly.
To hear the lonely cry, come from a poor lost soul,
You heal a broken heart; you save and make it whole.
