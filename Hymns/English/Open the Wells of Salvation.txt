1. Lord, I am fondly, earnestly longing
Into Thy holy likeness to grow;
Thirsting for more and deeper communion,
Yearning Thy love more fully to know.

Chorus:
Open the wells of grace and salvation,
(Open the wells of grace and salvation,)
Pour the rich streams deep into my heart;
(Pour the rich streams deep into my heart;)
Cleanse and refine my thought and affection.
(Cleanse and refine my thought and affection,)
Seal me and make me pure as Thou art.
(Seal me and make me pure as Thou art.)

2. Dead to the world would I be, O Father!
Dead unto sin, alive unto Thee;
Crucify all the earthly within me,
Emptied of sin and self may I be.

3. I would be Thine, and serve Thee forever,
Filled with Thy Spirit, lost in Thy love;
Come to my heart, Lord, come with anointing,
Showers of grace send down from above.
