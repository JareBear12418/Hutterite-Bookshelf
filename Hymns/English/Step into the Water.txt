1. It's time we the people stand up for what is right
It's time we squared our shoulders back
And raise our swords to fight
For the Bible is our weapon and the spirit is our shield
And the church needs more of its members
To be workers in the field.

Chorus: Step into the water
Wade down a little deeper
Wet your feet in the water of His love
Step into the water
Wade down a little deeper
Come join angels singing praises to the Lamb of God.

2. There is victory for the Christian who walks the narrow way
There has been a prize appointed
For the soul who does not stray
Oh I want to live for Jesus and be all that I should be
So that I can rest with Him forever in eternity.
