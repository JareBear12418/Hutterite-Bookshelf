1. Blessed Savior, we adore Thee,
We Thy love and grace proclaim;
Thou art mighty, Thou art holy,
Glorious is Thy matchless name.!

Chorus:
Glo - - - - rious, Glo - - - - rious,
(Glorious is Thy name, O Lord, Glorious is Thy name, O Lord!)
Glorious is Thy name, O Lord!
Glo - - - - rious, Glo - - - - rious,
(Glorious is Thy name, O Lord, Glorious is Thy name, O Lord!)
Glorious is Thy name, O Lord!

2. Great Redeemer, Lord and Master,
Light of all eternal days;
Let the saints of ev'ry nation
Sing Thy just and endless praise!

3. From the throne of heaven's glory
To the cross of sin and shame,
Thou didst come to die a ransom
Guilty sinners to reclaim.

4. Come, O come, immortal Savior,
Come and take Thy royal throne;
Come and reign, and reign forever,
Be the kingdom all Thine own!
