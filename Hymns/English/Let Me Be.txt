1. Let me be her fortress in the face of every storm;
Let me in a calloused world be sensitive and warm;
Let me be her hero when all others let her down;
Let me be her leader when there's weakness all around.

2. Let me be his sunshine when the skies are dark and gray;
Let me be his comfort when he's had a long hard day;
Let me be his shelter when the wind is harsh and cold;
Let me be submissive when the rest on earth are bold.

3. Let me be her pillar when she needs somewhere to lean;
Let me be committed with a heart that's true and clean;
Let me be attentive when there's something on her mind;
Let me lead her wisely when an answer's hard to find.

4. Let me be his pillow when he's tired and needs a rest;
Let me be assuring when he faces some hard task;
Let me listen closely when the world is pressing in;
Let me understand when no one else can comprehend.

5. Let me leave the pressures of the day outside my door;
Let me be unselfish, always willing to give more;
Let my love be real to her, each moment all the time;
Jesus, make me worthy of the hand I hold in mine.

6. Let me walk beside him when he needs to have a friend;
Let me be something real in a world of false pretense;
Let me sing sweet music when his heart's without a song;
Let me be his loving joy, each moment all along.

Jesus, make me worthy of the hand I hold in mine.
