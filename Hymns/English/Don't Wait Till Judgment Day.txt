1. They'll be moaning, they'll be groaning,
When the flames begin to roll,
They'll be kneeling, they'll be praying,
Like they've never prayed before;
But when all our suffering's over,
And the Lord will show his might,
Some are gonna be left, some are gonna be right.

Chorus:
Don't wait till Judgment Day,
To cast your sins away,
If you do, you're gonna see smoke and flames;
Hallelujah, lujah, get on the righteous side
And you won't be denied,
When the Lord up yonder calls your name.

2. They'll be sweating, they'll be fretting,
There'll be teardrops in your eyes,
They'll be calling on the Master
For a glimpse of Paradise;
No one knows what will become,
Of all the ones that shake with fright,
Some are gonna be left, some are gonna be right.

3. They'll be begging, they'll be pleading,
Won't you open up the door,
If you'll let me in, I promise,
I will sin no more;
But the Lord knows all that happens,
So you better seek the light,
Some are gonna be left, some are gonna be right.
