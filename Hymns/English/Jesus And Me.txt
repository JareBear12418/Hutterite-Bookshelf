1. I traveled alone upon this lonesome way,
My burdens were heavy and dark was my day;
I looked for a friend not knowing that He
Had all of the time been looking for me.

2. Now it is Jesus and me for each tomorrow,
For every heartache and for every sorrow;
I know that I can depend, upon my new found Friend,
And so till the end it's Jesus and me.

3. The road may be long, to Heaven's pearly gates,
I know that it's narrow, I know that it's straight;
But Jesus is there, thru eternity,
We'll travel alone just Jesus and me.

4. Forever, I'll sing of His great love to me,
Forever, I'll tell it on land and on sea;
I'll stay by His side, contented I'll be,
For all of my life it's Jesus and me.
