1. While traveling through the wilderness on Providence divine;
God led the way to Canaan Land where Israel was to dine.
From Egypt's bondage you were loosed, from slavery set free;
Now God commands you to possess the land of victory.

Chorus: Oh, come and live:
In Canaan Land where grapes of Eshcol sweetly grow;
Oh, come and live:
In Canaan Land and full salvation truly know.
Go in, possess:
The land is free, no price today do I demand,
Go in, possess:
Possess the clusters rich of blessings, oh, so grand.

2. Well, Israel oft provoked the Lord,
they murmured and complained,
The lesson seemed so hard to learn,
and little ground was gained.
Now do you move along with God, obedient to His call,
Or shrink into the wilderness, where doubters often fall?

3. Twelve spies where sent to search the land
and ten returned in woe,
They feared the giants would o'ertake and so refused to go.
But Joshua and Caleb's faith, in vigor was renewed,
Were able to possess the land where grapes of Eshcol grew.
4.
O brother, have you sent the spies of unbelief and doubt?
And found the land of victory has giants all about.
Send Joshua and Caleb too, and listen while they say,
'We're able to possess the land, possess the land today:'
