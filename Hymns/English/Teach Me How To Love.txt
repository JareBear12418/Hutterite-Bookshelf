1. Oh Jesus, teach me how to love this family,
Help me lay down my life for them;
For theirs nothing that means so much to me
That I'll rather keep than give.

Chorus:
Oh my Father, hear my plea today,
It's sincere from my heart;
That we as one might be a Jesus Church
Everyone a precious part.

2. Oh Jesus, show me how to serve this family
Help me always to put them first;
Break this vessel that keeps your love within,
That of your goodness they might never thirst.
