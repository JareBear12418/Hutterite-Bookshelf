1. For the Fathers bounteous care given from above,
Round about us everywhere, tokens of His love,
For the blessings of our days, which His grace imparts;
Sing we now a hymn of praise, forth from grateful hearts.

Chorus:
So with goodness in our hearts,
Sing praises, Sing praises,
(Praises joyfully we sing, And grateful tribute bring)
Glad praises (Unto the Lord our King)
Let us sing a hymn of praise, for the blessings of our days,
There is gladness in our hearts, this happy day.

2. Let us praise Him, for the gift of His only Son,
He who came our souls to lift, safe from error won;
For the story of the cross, that on earth He bore,
Triumph over earthly loss, praise Him evermore.

3. Send the wondrous message on, into lands afar,
Where with hope and courage gone, countless thousands are;
Tell them of the Father's love, give the comfort new,
That with joy all ills above, they may praise Him, too.
