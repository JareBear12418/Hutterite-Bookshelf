1. We thank Thee God for this, Thy food,
God is love, God is love,
But most of all for Jesus blood,
God is love, God is love;
His mercies bless and grant that we,
May live and feast and reign with Thee,
May live and feast and reign with Thee,
God is love, God is love.

2. We thank Thee God for this, Thy food,
God is love, God is love,
For life and health and every good,
God is love, God is love;
Let manna to our soul be giv'n,
The bread of life sent down from heaven,
And live and feast and reign with Thee,
God is love, God is love.
