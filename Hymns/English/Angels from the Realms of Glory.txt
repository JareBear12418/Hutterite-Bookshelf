1. Angels! from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:

Chorus:
Come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
Come and worship,
Worship Christ the newborn King.

2. Shepherds! in the field abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the heav'nly light:

3. Saints! before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear:

4. Sinners! wrung with true repentance,
Doomed for guilt to endless pains:
Justice now revokes the sentence,
Mercy calls you, break your chains:
