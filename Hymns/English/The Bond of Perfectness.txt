1. How sweet this bond of perfectness,
The wondrous love of Jesus;
A pure foretaste of heaven's bliss,
Of, fellowship so precious!

Chorus:
O brethren, how this perfect love
Unites us all in Jesus!
One heart, and soul, and mine, we prove
The union heaven gave us.

2. The bond that circles heaven's pure
Oh, wondrous, wondrous story!
Has dropped around the holy here,
And fills us all with glory.

3. Oh, praise the Lord for love divine
That binds us all together;
A thousand cords our hearts entwine,
Forever and forever.

4. Oh, mystery of heaven's peace!
Oh, bond of heaven's union!
Our souls in fellowship embrace,
And live in sweet communion.
