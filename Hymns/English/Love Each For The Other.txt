1. Today as we have gathered here to witness
The joining of these two to become one
We're reminded of the things the Lord has promised
That love and marriage are two holy things.
Chorus
Love each for the other,
Love, a life together, love,
Blessed in the sight of God;
Love, is always giving,
Love, is always sharing, love,
We're one forever more.
2
Young hearts we bless you in the name of Jesus
And ask the Lord to keep you in His care
Through clouds of doubt and fear. I know He'll lead you
And bring you two into His perfect way.
3
What God has joined let no man put asunder
These are the words that you will hear today
This day belongs to _______ and to _______,
Because this is their happy wedding (Hulba) day.
