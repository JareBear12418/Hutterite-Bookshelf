1. Just a tiny little boy stood in tears
On a busy street corner, What was he doing here
As he tried to explain, all he knew was his name
But it was late and beginning to rain

2. So I asked him about the place where he lived
He remembered the old church where the big cross was lit
And his eyes open wide he said with a smile
If you can get me to that cross I can find my way home

Chorus:
Show me the cross I can find my way home
Show me the cross and I'll know where to go
When I'm there beneath that cross I'm no longer lost
Show me the cross I'll find my way home.

3. There was a lonely old pathway I had walked
It was far from familiar and I found myself lost
But I remember the place were I first saw his face
I cried Lord Get me to that cross and I'll find my way home.
