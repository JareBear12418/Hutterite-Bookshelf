1. Faithful love flowing down from the thorn-covered crown,
Makes me whole, saves my soul, washes whiter than snow.
Faithful love calms each fear, reaches down, dries each tear;
Holds my hand when I can't stand on my own.

Chorus: Faithful love,from above,
(faithful lovefrom above)
Came to earth to show the Father's love.
And I'll never,be the same, -
(and I'll never    be the same)
For I've seen faithful love face to face,
And Jesus is His name.

2. Faithful love is a friend just when hope seems to end,
Welcome face, sweet embrace, tender touch filled with grace.
Faithful love, endless pow'r, living flame, Spirit's fire;
Burning bright in the night, guiding my way.
