1. O come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold Him Born, the King of angels.

Chorus:
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ, the Lord.

2. True God of the true God,
Light of light eternal,
Our lowly nature He hath not abhorred;
Son of the Father, Begotten, not created.

3. Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation,
O sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above:
Glory to God, all Glory in the highest.

4. Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning,
Jesus, to Thee be all glory giv'n;
Word of the Father, Now in flesh appearing.
