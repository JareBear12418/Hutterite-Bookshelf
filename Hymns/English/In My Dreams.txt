Chorus:
Jesus where did you take me last night in my dreams?
Did we walk side by side in the soft meadows green?
Did I drink living water from the heavenly stream?
Jesus where did you take me last night in my dreams?
1.
This morning I woke I was smiling inside
But I could not remember my dreams though I tried
There was only a feeling of heavenly scenes
Jesus where did you take me last night in my dreams?
(repeat chorus)

2. There was peace there was joy like I've not known before
Flooding my view like waves on the shore
I knew then that you had been washing me clean
Jesus where did you take me last night in my dreams?
(repeat chorus)
