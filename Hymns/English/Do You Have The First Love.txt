1. Do you have the first love that He gave you,
When you knelt at the altar that day;
Will you cry to your Lord, 'Please have mercy,
Save my soul, my sins take away.'

Chorus:
Do you have the first love that He gave you?
Is that fire still burning in your soul;
Would you feel the same way as you did on that day,
Does your zeal keep you pressing toward your goal?

2. Have you drifted away from the Savior?
Has your love that you had now grown cold;
Would you come and return and be faithful?
Now is the time to behold.
