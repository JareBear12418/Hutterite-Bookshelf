1. I will sing the wondrous story,
Of the Christ who died for me,
How He left His home in glory,
For the cross on Calvary.

Chorus:
Yes, I'll sing the wondrous sto - ry
(Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story)
Of the Christ who died for me,
(Of the Christ who died for me,)
Sing it with the saints in glory,
(Sing it with the saints in glory,)
Gathered by the crystal sea.
(Gathered by the crystal sea.)

2. I was lost, but Jesus found me,
Found the sheep that went astray;
Threw His loving arms around me,
Drew me back into His way.

3. I was bruised, but Jesus healed me,
Faint was I from many a fall,
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,
But He freed me from them all.

4. Days of darkness still come o'er me,
Sorrow's paths I often tread,
But the Savior still is with me,
By His hand I'm safely led.

5. He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He'll bear me safely over,
Where the saved ones I shall meet
