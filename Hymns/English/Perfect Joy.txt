When we get (when we get) to the other side,
We shall live eternally. (eternally.)

When we see (when we see) His face; (see His face)
In the gloryland where the saved ones stand,
Through redeem (through redeeming) ing grace. (redeeming grace)

Praises to (praises to) the Lamb; (to the Lamb)
From the blood washed throng, joyous words will ring
