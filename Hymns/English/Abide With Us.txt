1. Abide with us through all the coming years,
Stay close beside us through our joys and tears;
Be thou our comfort on life's toilsome way,
Be thou our guide and hear us when we pray.

2. Take thou our lives and blend them in thy love,
Our every vow we make to thee above;
We ask thy blessing as our hearts entwine,
In this our pledge of love, 0 Lord divine.

3. Touch thou our hearts, and make our love to be
Like unto that great love we've found in thee;
And may it last through all the days we share,
Deeper and richer growing; this is our prayer.
