1. He is now to be among you, at the calling of your heart,
Rest assured this trubador is acting on his part,
The union of your spirit here, has caused Him to remain,
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name.
There is love, there is love.

2. Well, a man shall leave his mother and a women leave her home,
They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one;
As it was in the beginning, is now and till the end,
Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again
And there's love, there is love.

3. Well then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife,
Is it love that brings you here, or love that brings you life?
Or if loving is the answer than who's the giving for?
Believe in something that you've never seen before,
O there's love, there is love.
