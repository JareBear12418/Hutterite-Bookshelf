1. May we be a shining light to the nations,
A shining light to the peoples of the earth;
Till the whole world sees the glory of your name;
May your pure light shine through us!

2. May we bring a word of hope to the nations,
A word of life to the peoples of the earth;
Till the whole world knows there's salvation through your name.
May your mercy flow through us!

3. May we sing a song of joy to the nations,
A song of praise to the peoples of the earth;
Till the whole world rings with the praises of your name.
May your song be sung through us!

4. May your kingdom come to the nations,
Your will be done in the peoples of the earth;
Till the whole world knows that Jesus Christ is Lord.
May your kingdom come on earth!
