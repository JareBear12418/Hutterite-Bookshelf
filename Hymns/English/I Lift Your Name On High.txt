Chorus:
Lord, I lift your name on high, (Lord, I lift your name on high)
Lord, I love to sing your praises, (Lord, I love to sing your praises)
I'm so glad you're in my life, (I'm so glad you're in my life)
I'm so glad you came to save us. (to save us)

1. You came from heaven to earth, to show the way,
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay,
From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky;
Lord, I lift your name on high.
