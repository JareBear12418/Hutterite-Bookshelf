1. Savior lead me lest I stray, (lest I stray,)
Gently lead me all the way; (all the way;)
I am safe when by Thy side, (by Thy side;)
I would in Thy love abide. (love abide.)

Chorus:
Lead me, lead me,
Savior lead me lest I stray, (lest I stray,)
Gently down the stream of time, (stream of time,)
Lead me, Savior, all the way, all the way.

2. Thou, the refuge of my soul, (of my soul,)
When life's stormy billows roll, (billows roll,)
I am safe when Thou art nigh, (Thou art nigh,)
On Thy mercy I rely. (I rely.)

3. Savior lead me till at last, (till at last,)
When the storm of life is past, (life is past,)
I shall reach the land of day, (land of day,)
Where all tears are wiped away. (wiped away.)
