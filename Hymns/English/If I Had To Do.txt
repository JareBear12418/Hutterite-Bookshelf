1. If I had it to do all over again,
I'd serve Jesus everyday of my life;
For I found He alone can really satisfy
And deliver me from all sin and strife.

Chorus:
Yes, it's Jesus! the only one,
Jesus, God's only Son.
Yes, it's Jesus that sets my soul free,
And it's Jesus Christ that's coming back for me.

2. So if you're looking for life, stop looking right now,
For it's Jesus that can give life to you;
So just open your heart and unlock it's door,
And let Jesus cleanse your life thru and thru.
