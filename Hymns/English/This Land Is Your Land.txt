CH:This land is your land, this land is my land;
From California to the New York Island.
From the Redwood Forest to the golf stream waters;
This land was made for you and me.

As I was walking that ribbon of highway,
I saw above me that endless skyway.
I saw below me that golden valley;
This land was made for you and me.

I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of the diamond deserts.
And all around me a voice was sounding,
'This land was made for you and me.'

When the sun was shining and I was strolling,
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting,
'This land was made for you and me.'
