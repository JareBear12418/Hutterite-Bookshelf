1. Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him, all creatures here below,
Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
2
Ye nations round the earth rejoice
Before the Lord your Sov'reign King;
Serve Him with cheerful heart and voice;
With all your tongues His glory sing.

3. The Lord is God: 'tis He alone
Doth life, and breath, and being give:
We are His work, and not our own;
The sheep that on His pasture live.
