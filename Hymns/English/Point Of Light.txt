1. There is a point, when you cannot walk away
When you have to stand up straight and tall, and mean the words you say
There is a point, you must decide, just to do it cause it is right
That's when you become a point of light.

2. There is a darkness that everyone must face
It wants to take what's good and fair and may it all to waste
And that darkness, covers everything in sight
Until it meets a single point of light.

Chorus:
All it takes is a point of light,
A ray of hope in the darkest night
If you seek what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light.

3. There are heroes who's names we never hear
A dedicated army of quiet volunteers
Reaching out to feed the hungry
Reaching out to save the land
Reaching out to help their fellow man.

4. There are dreamers who are making dreams come true
Taking time to teach the children, there's nothing they can't do
Giving shelter to the homeless, giving hope to those who vow
Isn't that what this land's all about
One by one from the mountains to the sea,
Points of light are calling out to you and me.
