1. Way up in Heaven there's a place that is free from all care,
Where there's no troubles, no worries, no burdens to bear;
Jesus has made it a place for the righteous to live,
Made it a place where the rich and the poor are the same.

2. Here on this earth we are told to obey His command,
Stand by the Savior and cling to His unchanging hand;
If we will serve, we'll reap our rewards by and by,
When we have entered that beautiful city on high.

3. When we have taken our last journey up to the sky,
When we have entered that beautiful city on high,
When we have looked on the face of our Savior and King,
Jesus will take us into His fast growing fold.

4. Friends, while you're living, won't you try to live for the King,
Praise Him and serve Him with words and the music you sing;
Time swiftly passes soon your life on this earth will be done,
There up in heaven and there at the beautiful throne.
