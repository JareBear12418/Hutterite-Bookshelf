1. Satan has parted fathers and mothers,
Filling their hearts with his envy and hate,
Heading their pathway down to destruction,
Leaving their children like orphans to stray.

Chorus:
The family who prays will never be parted,
It's circle in heaven unbroken shall stand;
God will say enter my good faithful servant,
The family who prays never shall part.

2. Wars and tornadoes are taking our loved ones,
Leaving us tearful with sad aching hearts,
But we shall join them over the river,
Where the family who prays never shall part.
