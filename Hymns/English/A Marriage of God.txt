1. Today as we witness the joining of loved ones,
As together they stand in the presence of God;
Making a promise to love and to cherish
Now and forever till death do them part.

Chorus:
A marriage of God shall never be parted,
Their vows now in heaven unbroken shall stand;
God will be with them, His dear faithful servant
A marriage of God never shall part.

2. _____ and _____ together before us,
Their vows now are spoken to God up above;
May their love grow stronger as they grow older,
With faith in each other and faith in the Lord.

3. _____ and _____ they're bound now together,
Walking the pathway of life hand in hand;
May their love grow sweeter as every day passes,
Bringing them closer to God with their prayers.

4. _____ and _____ together before us,
Sharing their life now together as one;
Each for the other, and both for the Savior
Wishing them happiness year after year.
