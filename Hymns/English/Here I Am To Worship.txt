1. Light of the world, you stepped down into darkness;
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore you,
Hope of a life spent with you.

Chorus: Here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that you're my God.
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
2
King of all days, oh so highly exalted,
Glorious in heaven above.
Humbly you came to the earth you created;
All for loves' sake, became poor.
3
I'll never know how much it cost,
To see my sin upon that cross.
I'll never know how much it cost,
To see my sin upon that cross.
