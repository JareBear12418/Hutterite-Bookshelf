1. In this life we have sorrows and burdens;
There are times that we don't understand;
But He'll make it plain in the morning,
So we'll hold to His unchanging hand.

Chorus:
Rest by the side of the river,
(We shall rest by the side of the river,)
Crossed o'er the deep rolling tide;
(When we've crossed o'er the deep rolling tide;)
With the angels we'll sing there forever,
(We will sing there forever,)
And with Jesus we'll ever abide.

2. Soon the daystar will rise in its splendor;
And the mist then will all roll away;
For the Lamb is the Light of that country
It will all be an endless today.

3. We will sing by the side of the river;
As we tell of His wonderful grace;
His brightness behold there forever,
And we'll never grow tired of His praise.
