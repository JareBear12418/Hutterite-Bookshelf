1. I've been standing near a gate
Looking down the narrow lane,
And I see the multitude gather there;
Clad in garments white as snow
Walking streets of purest gold,
All the saved are coming home
Forever more.

Chorus:
In the midst is the king
(In the midst is the king)
Little Children at His feet,
(Little Children at His feet,)
No more pain will they know
(No more pain will they know)
He has'touched and made them whole.
Happy voi - ces fill the air
(Happy voices fill the air, fill the air)
There is singing everywhere,
(Where is singing everywhere, everywhere,)
What a sight to behold
(What a sight to behold)
The redeemed are coming home.
(The redeemed are coming home.)

2. O how sweet it is to hear
Mama singing loud and clear,
And the sound of angel wings on my ear;
Saints have come from far and near
Ne'er again to know a care
But to spend eternal days
With the Lord.
