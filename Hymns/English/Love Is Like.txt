1. Love is like a wind of spring,
A life renewed, the gift it brings;
We know its joys, we know its stings
Love is like, love is like a wind of spring.

2. Love is like a sun at dawn,
It lights the road we travel on;
Enduring when all else is gone,
Love is like, love is like a sun at dawn.

3. Love is like a winter's snow,
Bestowing beauty where it blows;
Transforming all the world we know,
Love is like, love is like a winter's snow.

4. Love is something we must share,
To help anothers need to bear;
It teaches us how we must care,
Love is some, love is something we must share.
