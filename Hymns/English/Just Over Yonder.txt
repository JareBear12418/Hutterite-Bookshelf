1. Just over yonder beyond the river,
There is a city of pure delight.
Where many loved ones are congregating,
With songs of victory, and robes of white.

Chorus: Just over yonder (yonder there)
There'll be no heartaches, (heartaches there)
No lonely days up there will ever come.
There'll be no crying, there'll be no dying,
Oh, what rejoicing when we get home.

2. There's nothing here, friends, but disappointment,
So often, here we are left alone.
But over yonder, hearts soon grow fonder,
And separation will never come.

3. Just over yonder, we'll soon be going
To see the Savior upon His throne.
And hear a welcome ring out through heaven,
Oh weary pilgrim, this is your home.
