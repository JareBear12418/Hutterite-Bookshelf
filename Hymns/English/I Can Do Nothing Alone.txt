1. I plowed the field and I planted the corn,
I worked my hands to the bone;
But the ground lay barren till He sent the sunshine,
For I can do nothing alone.

Chorus:
I can do nothing alone,
I'm weak but my Master is strong;
I held the pencil, but He wrote this song,
For I can do nothing alone.

2. I hitched up the team and I rode to the mill,
With the best crop that I'd ever grown;
But the wheel wouldn't grind it, till He stirred the water
For I can do nothing alone.

3. And now as my years lead me out of this valley,
I've asked Him to please come along;
For I walk in search of the good life here after,
For I can do nothing alone.
