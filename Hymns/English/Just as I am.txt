1. Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that thou bidd'st me come to thee,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

2. Just as I am, and waiting not,
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

3. Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict many a doubt
Fightings and fears within, without,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

4. Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in thee I find,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

5. Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
Because Thy promise I believe,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!

6. Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down:
Now, to be thine, yea, thine alone,
Oh Lamb of God, I come! I come!
