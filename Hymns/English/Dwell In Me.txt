1. Dwell in me O blessed Spirit
How I need Thy help divine;
In the way of life eternal
Keep, oh, keep this heart of mine.

Chorus:
Dwell in me, O blessed Spirit,
Gracious teacher, friend divine;
For the home of bliss' that waits me
O prepare this heart of mine.

2. Round the cross where Thou hast led me,
Let my purest feeling twine;
With the blood from sin that cleansed me
Seal anew this heart of mine.

3. Let me feel Thy sacred presence
Then my faith will ne'er decline;
Comfort Thou and help me onward
Fill with love this heart of mine.
