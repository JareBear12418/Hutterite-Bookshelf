Chorus: There is no other name, there is no other name
Under Heaven given to man by which we must be saved
There is no other name, there is no other name
Every tongue will confess the blessed name of Jesus

1. There is one who can heal the diseases of the body
There is one who can heal the diseases of the soul
Others try and pretend that they have this kind of power
But there's no other name that you really need to know
(repeat chorus)

2. In the name of the Lord we have found complete redemption
In the name of the Lord we have hope beyond the grave
And there's no other way to be sure we are bound for Heaven
There is no other name with the awesome power to save
(repeat chorus)
