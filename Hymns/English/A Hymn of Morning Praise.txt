1. O God, inspire our morning hymn
Of love and gratitude;
Oh, bless the sacrifice we bring,
Thou Source of every good.

Refrain:
Touched by Thy hand of love, we wake,
And rise from sweet repose;
Thy praise shall first the silence break,
Thy peace within us flows.

2. Thy miracle of love so sweet
Preserved us all secure;
While helpless in unconscious sleep,
Thy presence kept us pure.

3. 'Tis blest to rise, O Lord, and join
With nature's minstrelsy;
To hymn Thy praise at early morn,
And offer thanks to Thee.

4. Sweet morning is the time to pray;
How lovely and how meet,
To send our early thoughts away
Up to the mercy seat.

5. The glorious sun has driven far
The mystic shades of night;
So in our souls the morning star
Hath shed His wondrous light.
