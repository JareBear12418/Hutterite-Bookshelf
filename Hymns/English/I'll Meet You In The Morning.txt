1. I will meet you in the morning, by the bright river side,
When all sorrow has drifted away;
I'll be standing at the portals, when the gates open wide,
At the close of life's long, dreary day.

Chorus:
Meet you in the morning, meet you in the morning,
(I'll meet you in the morning,)
'How do you do,' 'How do you do,'
(with a 'How do you do, ')
sit down by the river, sit down by the river,
(and well sit down by the river)
Rapture our 'old' acquaintance renew;
(And with rapture 'old' acquaintance renew;)
Know me in the morning know me in the morning,
(You'll know me in the morning,)
Smiles that I wear, smiles that I wear,
(By the smiles that I wear,)
Meet you in the morning, meet you in the morning,
(When I meet you in the morning,)
City, city built, that city built foursquare
(In the city that is built, foursquare.)

2. I will meet you in the morning, in the sweet by and by,
And exchange the old cross for a crown;
There will be no disappointments and nobody shall die,
In that land where the sun goeth down.

3. I will meet you in the morning, at the end of the way,
On the streets of that city of gold;
Where we all can be together and be happy for aye,
While the years and the ages shall roll.
