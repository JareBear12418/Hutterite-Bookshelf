1. They, who first sinned there in Eden,
Heard the footsteps of God as He came,
Calling out to them, 'Where art thou?'
They hid their faces in shame.

Chorus: Can't you hear Him crying in the garden?
A brokenhearted Savior that day.
Weeping for His straying children,
And those who have turned Him away.

2. While the city slept in the distance,
There on the hillside I see;
Jesus with heart heavy-laden,
Kneeling in Gethsemane.
