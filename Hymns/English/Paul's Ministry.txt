1. The Lord said, Stand up, Paul, and dry up your tears
You must preach my Gospel, for many long years;
Go to Damascus, the way that's called Strait,
You'll meet Ananias, and there you must wait.

Chorus:
I counted on Adam, I counted on Cain,
I counted on Jonah, but he was the same;
I counted on Judas, but he proved untrue,
So go tell the world, Paul, I'm counting on you.

2. Three days have gone by, Lord, and yet I don't see,
But here stands my brother atalking with me;
He said, Brother Paul, the Lord in the skies,
Has sent me to heal you and open your eyes.

3. I'll send you to the Gentiles, I'll send you to Rome,
But, Paul, you must suffer, 'ere I call you home;
You'll sleep in the desert, you'll be wrecked out at sea,
But keep right on preaching my Gospel for me.
