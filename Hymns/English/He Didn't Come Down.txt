1. Often I stop to think, just where I'd be,
Had Jesus come down from that cruel tree;
There'd be no hope for man, no peace could be found;
Praise God, I'm glad that He didn't come down.

Chorus: He didn't come down, oh no, He didn't come down,
Ten thousand angels were camped all around;
He could have called them, to set Him free,
But He stayed on that cross for you and for me.

2. Picture His mother there, with tears in her eyes,
As they mocked and scorned Him and pierced His side.
They said, 'If thou be King, then come to the ground.'
But He prayed, 'Forgive them;' and He didn't come down.
