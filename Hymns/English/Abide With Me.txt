1. Abide with me: fast fall the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide;
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

2. Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see:
O Thou who changest not, abide with me!

3. I need Thy presence ev'ry passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Thru cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!

4. Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine thru the gloom, and point me to the skies;
Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!
