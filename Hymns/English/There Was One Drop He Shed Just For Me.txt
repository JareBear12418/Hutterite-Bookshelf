When the man of Galilee,
Hung upon the cruel tree,
He was dying for sinners like me;
As the blood came dripping down,
From the cross unto the ground,
There was one drop He shed just for me.

Chorus:
Just for me and sins of my soul (sins of my soul,)
Just to cleanse me and make me whole, (make me whole,)
There was pardon extended to me;
As the blood came dripping down,
From the cross unto the ground,
There was one drop He shed just for me.

2. When they pierced His precious side,
'O forgive them now,' He cried,
There was pardon extended to me;
As the blood and water came,
Glory to His precious name,
And that one drop He shed just for me.

3. When with all the saints I stand,
Over in that happy land,
And it's beauties I'm able to see;
As I look upon His face,
I shall thank Him for His grace,
And that one drop He shed just for me.
