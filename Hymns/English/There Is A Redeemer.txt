1. There is a Redeemer,
Jesus, God's own Son;
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
Holy One.

Chorus: Thank-you, oh, my Father,
For giving us your Son,
And leaving your Spirit
Till the work on earth is done.

2. Jesus, my Redeemer,
Name above all names,
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
Hope for sinners slain.

3. When I stand in glory,
I will see His face.
There I'll serve my King forever
In that holy place.
