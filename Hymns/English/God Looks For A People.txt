1. The time we have is precious, we have no time to waste;
n looking over shoulders to see who'll take our place.
Ne need to have a vision and not a sense of lack;
(ou'll never make decisions if you keep on looking back.

Chorus:
And God looks for a people, the faithful and the strong,
To speak to situations and cause things to be born.
Captives of a vision, singers of a song,
Who'll only live to see his kingdom come.
Who'll only live to see his kingdom come.

2. The fields are white with harvest, the laborers are few.
The Word comes to the people, 'What now will you do?
Will you sit in introspection until the coming day?
Or will you rise like young men and will you lead the way?'

3. We can't boast of tomorrow, we only have today.
he past lies dead behind us, forgotten along the way.
Let faith rise up among us, and see his kingdom come.
Let's run the race with joy, and let's see his will be done.

4. So will we be that people, or will he pass us by?
Is there no one among us who'll even dare to try?
Or will his zeal consume us and will our lives be run;
Seeing kingdoms overthrown in the name of God's own Son?
