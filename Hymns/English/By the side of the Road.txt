1. I've been traveling for Jesus for most of my life,
Over hills and valleys so low,
I've been tempted by the trials of troubles and strife,
But someday I'll be home with the Lord,

Chorus: In the shadow of this journey when friends seem so few,
I have prayed for the Lord to be close,
I believe I heard Him walking in the cool of the day
As I sit by the side of the road.

2. Just ahead is the sunset when Jesus will say
No more work in the vineyard for you,
He will rock me to sleep in the cradle of time,
I'll awake in the harbor of love.

3. Someday across the river beside the home gate,
I may look back to earth here below,
I may see a dear brother I've known on the road,
Sitting down by the side of the road.
