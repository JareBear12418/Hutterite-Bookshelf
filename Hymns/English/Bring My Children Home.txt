1. I can hear a distant cry,
Shouting out, 'The time is nigh;'
As the Father tells his Son,
'Work on earth this day is done.'

Chorus:
Son, go bring my children home,
For I want them gathered 'round my throne;
It's time to reap the harvest you have sown;
Son go bring (Son go bring) my children home.

2. What a joy to see his face,
In his arms we will embrace.
Never more we'll have to roam,
For we've finally made it home.
