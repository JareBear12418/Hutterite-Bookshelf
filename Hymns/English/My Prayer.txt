1. As I knelt by my bedside early this morn
To pray to my God who's up in heaven
For his help today through the trial of life
He loves both you and me.

Chorus:
I wonder when Jesus is coming again
To call home all who believe
When the trumpet shall sound and the heavens part
To see him coming down.

2. And later today I was thinking of him
How he hung on the cross to save me from sin
His blood was shed for all who believe
He loves both you and me.

3. Now tonight as I kneel by my bedside again
To thank my father up in heaven
He was with me today through the storms of life
He loves both you and me.
