1. This old world is nothing but a dressing place,
Where we make preparations to spend that endless day;
Until that curtain opens and it's our time to sing,
We are just rehearsing songs of praise to the King.

Chorus:
We're just rehearsing, we're just rehearsing
And someday we'll sing together in a band around God's Throne,
This old world cannot reward us,
(This old world cannot reward us,)
We are just just rehearsing for that singing up home.
(We are just)

2. When I sing of Jesus, of His saving grace,
I feel His blessed presence, my soul He does engrave;
Sometimes I'm so happy I forget my song,
I know I've been invited to that singing up home.

3. We'll sing the songs of Moses with words of sweetest praise,
Through God and all His glory we'll see Him face to face;
And hear those voices ringing of loved ones who are gone,
We'll blend our voices with angels in that singing up home.
