1. A woman one day tried many physicians,
But rather grew worse in the Bible we're told;
Until one glad day, she came to Jesus
And found what she wanted for body and soul.

Chorus:
If I could just touch the hem of His garment
If I could just touch some part of His robe,
I know I'd be healed, my sins all forgiven,
If I could just touch Him, I know I'd be whole.

2. Bartimaeus sat by the wayside begging,
With no one to help on life's weary way,
Till Jesus came by and He heard his sad crying
He touched his blind eyes, and He healed them that day.

3. Nicodemus, he came to Jesus by night,
To ask Him the way of salvation and light;
He could not understand, how a man that was old
Could be born of the spirit and of life for his soul.
