1. I praise you for your faithfulness, O Lord,
And for your Father's love that never fails.
Who am I, the King of love my shepherd is,
Who am I, that you should call me friend?

2. Made lower than the angels for a time,
To suffer death, for only you alone
Are my one high priest, my only sacrifice,
And my advocate before the throne.

3. For though you know all my ways,
Yet your love for me endures.
When I think on all these things,
Oh, I love you more and more.
