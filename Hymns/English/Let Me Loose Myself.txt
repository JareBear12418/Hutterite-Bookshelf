1. Many years I've longed for rest,
Perfect peace within my breast,
But I often sought the Lord alone in tears;
Yet I could not pay the price,
Could not pay the sacrifice,
So I wandered on and on for many a years.

Chorus:
Let me loose myself and find it, Lord, in thee,
May all self be slain my friends see only thee;
Though it cost me grief and pain,
I will find my life again,
If I loose myself and find it, Lord, in thee.

2. Then one day while bowed in prayer,
Jesus whispered to me there,
Take up thy cross and follow me to Calvary,
Oh, how hard it was to die,
And myself to crucify,
Just to loose myself and find it, Lord, in thee.

3. Lord, I could not stand alone,
When I come before thy throne,
Let me bring at least one soul o, Lord, to thee;
Here I gave myself away,
Take me, use me, Lord, I pray,
Let me loose myself and find it, Lord, in thee.
