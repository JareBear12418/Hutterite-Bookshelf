1. I'm just a weary pilgrim
Traveling through a troubled land,
My home is over Jordan,
Where there's peace on every hand;
For me this world holds nothing
It soon shall pass away,
The more I think about it,
The less I want to stay

Chorus:
The more I think about it,
The more I want to go,
There's a lot of trouble
And sorrow here below;
I'm longing for that homeland
Where crystal rivers flow,
The more I think about it,
The more I want to go.

2. I heard about a mansion
That the Lord went to prepare,
And I think of all my loved ones
Who are waiting for me there;
Oh, I get all excited
And I know it won't be long
Till I meet Jesus, then I
Hear Him bid me welcome home.
