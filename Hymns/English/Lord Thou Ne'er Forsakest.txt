1. Lord, Thou ne'er forsakest
Him who waits on Thee;
None has e'er rejected,
Wouldst Thou then leave me?
No, Thou canst not fail me,
O Thou faithful God!
Heav'n and earth may vanish,
Yet Thou changest not.

2. Hear the words of Jesus:
'Ask, and I shall give,
Of the living waters
Drink and ye shall live.'
With a faith unwav'ring,
Seek and ye shall find;
Knock, and heaven's portals
Shall be opened wide.

3. Jesus, I'll obey Thee,
And no longer doubt;
Thou wilt thus receive me,
Wilt not cast me out.
All my pain and anguish,
All my grief and care;
All my greatest burdens
Thou wilt surely bear.

4. Thou art my Redeemer,
And my truest friend;
Sun of life, that shineth
To my journey's end.
When the shadows lengthen,
And the night is come;
Safely through death's valley
Thou wilt lead me home.
