1. When troubles surround us, When evils come,
The body grows weak, The spirit grows numb;
When these things beset us, He doesn't forget us,
He sends down His love, On the wings of a dove.

Chorus:
On the wings of a snow white dove,
He sends His pure, sweet love;
A sign from above,
On the wings of a dove.

2. When Noah had drifted, On the flood many days,
He searched for land, In various ways;
Troubles he had some, But wasn't forgotten,
He sends down His love, On the wings of a dove.

3. When Jesus went down, To the waters that day,
He was baptized, In the usual way;
When it was done, God blessed His Son,
He sent Him His love, On the wings of a dove
