1. Mighty waves the storm is tossing o'er our ship at sea;
Roaring winds around it raging fling it helplessly.

Chorus:
Courage, see the Savior,
Hear Him now declare:
'I am with you day by day, Yes,
My help I give, do not despair!
O, I am with you day by day, yes,
My help I give, do not despair.'

2. On the decks the sailors gather, helpless ev'ry one;
All are calling to the Master and His help is come.

3. On life's ocean wild and stormy, dangers threat'ning come,
Yet glad tidings ring out joyfully: He saves ev'ry one!

4. Jesus came to save His children as through storms they roam.
Leave the wreckage, look to Him, then; He will lead you Home!
