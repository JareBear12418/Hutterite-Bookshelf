1. O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer:
This is my constant longing and pray'r;
Gladly I'll forfeit all of earth's treasures,
Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.

Chorus:
O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

2. O to be like Thee! full of compassion,
Loving, forgiving, tender and kind,
Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wand'ring sinner to find.

3. O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless, tender and kind,
Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer, others to save.

4. O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming,
Now to receive th'anointing divine;
All that I am and have I am bringing;
Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.

5. O to be like Thee! while I am pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love;
Make me a temple meek for Thy dwelling,
Fit me for life and heaven above.
