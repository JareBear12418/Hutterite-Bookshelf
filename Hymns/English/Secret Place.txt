1. My heart is like a house,
One day I let the Savior in;
And there are many rooms,
Where we would visit now and then.
But then one day he saw that door,
I knew the day had come too soon;
I said, 'Jesus, I'm not ready,
For us to visit in that room:'

2.' Cause that's a place in my heart,
Where even I don't go;
I have some things hidden there,
I don't want no one to know:'
But he handed me the key,
With tears of love on his face;
He said, 'I want to make you clean,
Let me go in your secret place.'

3. Then I opened up the door,
And as the two of us walked in;
I was so ashamed,
His light revealed my hidden sin;
But when I think about that room now,
I'm not ashamed anymore;
'Cause I know my hidden sin,
No longer hides behind the door.

4. There was a place in my heart,
Where even I wouldn't go;
I had some things hidden there,
I didn't want no one to know.
But he handed me the key,
With tears of love on his face;
He made me clean,
I let him in my secret place.

5. Is there a place in your heart,
Where even you don't go?
You have some things hidden there,
You don't want no one to know?
But he's handing you the key,
With tears of love on his face;
He wants to make you clean,
Let him in your secret place.
