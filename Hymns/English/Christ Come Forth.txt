1. Christ come forth in me,
Till my life I no longer can see,
Till the day breaks forth
And the darkness is gone;
Christ come forth in me.

2. Give me silver till I need no more,
That thy redemption may be fully restored.
That the whole world may know,
That it's no longer I,
But Christ that liveth in me.

3. Give me gold till I need no more,
That thy nature may be fully restored,
Till the price has been paid
And I am overlaid,
Both inside and outside with gold.

4. As I stand in the name of the Son,
And the work has been completely done;
Laid me down at the cross,
Counting all things but loss
Till Christ comes forth in me.
