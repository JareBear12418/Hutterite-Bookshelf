1. Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace;
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He'll prepare for us a place.

Chorus:
When we all get to heaven,
(When we all)
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
(What a day of rejoicing that will be!)
When we all see Jesus,
(When we all)
We'll sing and shout the victory.
(shout, and shout the victory.)

2. While we walk the pilgrim pathway
Clouds will overspread the sky;
But when trav'ling days are over
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

3. Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving ev'ry day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

4. Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open
We shall tread the streets of gold.
