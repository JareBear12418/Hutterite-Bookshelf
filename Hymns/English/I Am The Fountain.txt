1. I am the fountain, Lord, you are the water,
The water of life forever.
I am the riverbed, you are the river,
The river that runs dry '  no never.

Chorus:
I am the messenger, you are the message,
The message that sets every bound captive free.
Come Holy Spirit, and fill every vessel;
I am but one vessel '  here I am.

2. I am the lantern, Lord, you are the flame,
The flame that will die '  not ever.
Holy, Unchanging One, ever the same,
The same heavenly Father forever.
