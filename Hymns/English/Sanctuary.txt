Chorus:
Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary,
Pure and holy, tried and true;
With thanksgiving, I'll be a living
Sanctuary for you.

1. It is you, Lord, who came to save
The heart and soul of every man.
It is you, Lord, who knows my weakness,
Who gives me strength with thine own hand.

2. Lead me on, Lord, from temptation,
Purify me from within.
Fill my heart with your Holy Spirit,
Take away all my sin.
