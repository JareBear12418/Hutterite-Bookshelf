1. Sweet is the tho't when a storm is sweeping,
Making such a dreary day;
Safe are our souls in the Master's keeping;
Love will roll the clouds away.

Chorus:
(Love will Roll) Love will roll
(The clouds away) the clouds away;
(Love will Roll) Love will roll
(The clouds away) the clouds away;
Trust and be true all is well with you.
(Love will Roll) Love will roll
The clouds away (the clouds away.)

2. Sweet is the tho't when our burden's bond us,
When the tempter would dismay;
Jesus will strengthen and defend us;
Love will roll the clouds away.

3. Sweet is the tho't when we reach the river,
When for light and cheer we pray;
Jesus our Friend will be with us ever;
Love will roll the clouds away.
