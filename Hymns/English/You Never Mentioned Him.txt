1. When in the better land
Before the Lord we stand,
How deeply grieved our souls may be,
If any lost one there,
Should cry in deep despair,
'You never mentioned him to me.'

Chorus:
You never mentioned him to me;
You helped me not, the light to see.
You met me day by day, and knew I was astray,
Yet never mentioned him to me.

2. O let us spread the Word
Where'er it may be heard.
Help groping souls the light to see,
That yonder none may say,
'You showed me not the way;
You never mentioned him to me.'

3. A few sweet words may guide
A lost one to his side,
Or turn sad eyes on Calvary.
So work as days go by,
That yonder none may cry,
'You never mentioned him to me.'
