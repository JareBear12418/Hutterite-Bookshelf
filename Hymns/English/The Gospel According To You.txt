1. There's a sweet old story translated for men,
But wrote in the long, long ago;
It's the gospel according to Mark, Luke, and John,
Of Christ and His mission below.
Men read and admire this gospel of Christ,
With its love unfailing and true;
But what do they say and what do they think
Of the gospel according to you.

Chorus: And you're writing a gospel, a chapter each day,
By deeds that you do and words that you say;
Men read what you write, whether faithless or true;
Say what is the gospel according to you.

2. It's a wonderful story this gospel of Christ,
With its love unfailing and true;
But what do men say and what do they think
Of the gospel according to you.
Now in writing each day your letter to men,
Take care that your writing is true;
It's the only gospel some men will ever hear,
This gospel according to you.
