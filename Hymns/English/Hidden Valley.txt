1. In a hidden valley, just over the hill,
A young shepherd boy surrenders his will,
As he lifts his voice in praise to his King;
Only the lambs will hear and follow as he sings.

Chorus:
Hidden valleys produce a life 'song;
Hidden valleys will make the heart strong.
Desperation can cause you to sing,
Hidden valleys turn shepherds to kings.

2. In a hidden valley a faithful one weeps;
No one looking on, he cares for their needs,
For he knows the one who tries the heart,
So he is steadfast and content to do his part.

3. In a hidden valley a leader is born;
He has faced the fear and weathered the storm;
So with humble heart and love for his God,
He becomes royalty with just a staff and rod.
