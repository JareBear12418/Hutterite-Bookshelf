1. Watch the rain fall over the fields in the valley,
Hear the thunder roll across the sky;
See the sunrays shine thru a wall without windows
We hold hands and smile at what money can't buy.

Chorus:
We have a mansion seen only by you and me,
Our days without sunshine are few;
We've always loved even those who made us cry,
We hold hands and smile at what money can't buy.

2. Our children are playing no shoes on their feet,
And patch after patch on their knee;
Yet we hear only laughter and people ask why,
We hold hands and smile at what money can't buy.
