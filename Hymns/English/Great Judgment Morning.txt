1. On a cold winter eve, as the snowflakes were falling,
In a low humble cottage, A poor mother laid;
And although reckless thing, as she laid there contended,
With the Savior her friend, and the peace within made.

Chorus:
We will all meet again on that great judgment morning,
The book will be open, the roads will be closed;
Oh, how sad it will be if forever we're parted,
While some rise to glory, and others stand to foe.

2. Oh, that mother of yours has gone o'er the river,
And you promised to meet her while you knelt at her bed;
As the death sweat rolled off, and fell on her pillow,
Oh, the memories still live, although she is gone.

3. Do, remember the kiss and the last words she uttered,
Oh, the arms that embraced you are with you no more;
As you stand by her grave, teardrops fell on her casket.
And we bow there to meet her on that happy shore.
