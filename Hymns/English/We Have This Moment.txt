1. Hold tight to sound of the music of living,
Happy song from laughter of children at play.
Hold my hand as we run through the sweet fragrant meadows.
Making memories of what was today.

Chorus:
We have this moment to hold in our hands.
And to touch as it slips through our fingers like sand.
Yesterday's gone and tomorrow may never come.
But we have this moment today.

2. Tiny voice that I hear is my little girl calling.
For her Daddy to hear just what she has to say.
And my little son running there by the hillside,
May never be quite like today.

3. Tender words gentle touch and a kiss of affection.
And someone who loves me and wants me to stay.
Hold them dear while they're here and don't wait for tomorrow,
To look back and wish for today.
