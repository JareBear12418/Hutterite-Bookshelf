Chorus: Are you dressed for the wedding;
Have you washed your robes?
Are you dressed for the banquet;
Are you ready to go?
Are your lamps trimmed and burning with the Spirit's light?
Are you ready for the wedding,
if the groom comes tonight?

1. Have you heard that there's a wedding?
And it's coming soon, I know.
The whole wide world's invited,
Are ready now to go?
Oh, there will be a banquet, won't you come and dine?
See the King of all the ages turning water into wine.

2. When you hear that trumpet sounding
On that bright and glorious day.
When you hear the angels singing,
You will up and fly away.
There will be a celebration like none the world has known,
On that everlasting morning
When the Lord comes for His own.
