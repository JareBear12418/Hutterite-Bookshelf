1. Silent night! Holy night!
All is calm, all is bright,
Round yon virgin mother and Child;
Holy Infant, so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

2. Silent night! Holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight!
Glorious stream from heaven afar,
Heav'nly hosts sing alleluia.
Jesus, the Savior, is born!
Jesus, the Savior, is born.

3. Silent night! Holy night!
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.
