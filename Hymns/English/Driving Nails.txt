1. Since that blessed night in a manger,
she watched her baby grow.
Seems like yesterday He was in her arms,
where did the time go?
He learned His father's trade, as she marveled at it all,
Sweat dropped from the little carpenter,
as He made the timbers fall.

Chorus: She can hear them driving nails upon the hillside,
And she prays that His spirit will not fail.
She watches as a young man undertakes His Father's will,
As she stands and listens to the driving nails.
2
In the streets of Jerusalem a child can disappear,
She was frantic as she looked for Him, till she began to hear,
Hammers up at the temple, she called Him as she ran,
Surprised she found Him teaching like no ordinary man.

3. Darkness covered all the land in the middle of the day,
She began to tremble as the earth began to quake,
Hammers, nails and timbers of the carpenter's trade,
Made a sound that pierced her soul
as the cross was being raised.

As she cries and listens to the driving nails.
