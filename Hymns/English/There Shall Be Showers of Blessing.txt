1. 'There shall be showers of blessing'
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Savior above.

Chorus:
Show - ers of blessing,
(Showers, showers of blessing,)
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercydrops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

2. 'There shall be showers of blessing'
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys
Sound of abundance of rain.

3. 'There shall be showers of blessing'
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,
Come and now honor Thy Word.

4. 'There shall be showers of blessing'
O that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!
