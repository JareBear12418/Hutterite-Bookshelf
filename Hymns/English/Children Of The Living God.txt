1. Children of the living God,
Come and sing, sing out loud,
Children of the living God,
Sing to the living God.
Sing of the wonders He has made:
Bird in flight, falling rain;
Sing of the wonders He has made,
Sing to the living God.

Chorus: How He loves us with great love,
He who sits enthroned above.
For our lives He spilled His blood,
Sent His Spirit like a flood;
Children of the living God,
Sing to the living God.

2. Sing of His gentle healing hands,
How they found the lowliest man,
Sing of His gentle healing hands,
Sing to the living God.
Sing of the mercy that He gives,
Though we sin, He forgives,
Sing of the mercy that He gives;
Sing to the living God

3. Sing for the morning when He comes,
In the clouds, glorious Son,
Sing for the morning when He comes,
Sing to the living God.
