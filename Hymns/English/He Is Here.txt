Chorus:
He is here, hallelujah; He is here, amen.
He is here, holy, holy,
I will bless his name again.
He is here, listen closely;
Hear him calling out your name.
He is here, you can touch him,
You will never be the same.

1. I sense an awesome moving of the Holy Spirit;
I see his countenance resting on your face.
I know that there are angels hovering all around us,
For the presence of the Lord is-in this place.

2. I searched for peace among the shadows dark and lonely,
Gave up on finding that strong and lasting love;
I tasted all the things, that sin could think to offer me,
But today I feast on manna from above.
