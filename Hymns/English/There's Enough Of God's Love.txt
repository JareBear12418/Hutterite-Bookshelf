1. There's enough of God's love to fill the ocean deep;
There's enough of God's love to scale a mountain steep;
There's enough of God's love to touch the highest star;
There's enough of God's love to fill a man's heart.

2. There's enough of God's love to make living life a real joy;
There's enough of God's love all hatred could be destroyed;
If mankind would only try God's love for what it's worth;
There's enough of God's love to bring peace on earth.

3. There's enough of God's love for anyone, anywhere;
There's enough of God's love for everyone, everywhere;
If the love of God would fill the heart of every man-
There would still be enough left to do it again.
