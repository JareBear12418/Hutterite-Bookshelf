1. After you've known God, the blessed Savior,
After you felt His saving power;
How can you go back there and deny Him,
There's nothing out there for the soul that's once known God.

Chorus:
There's nothing out there for the soul that's known God,
No peace, no pleasure can be found;
There's nothing but sorrow and disappointment,
There's nothing out there for the soul that's once known God.

2. I'd rather die than, deny my Savior,
Or bring reproach to His great name;
Or give the devil a chance to claim me,
There's nothing out there for the soul that's once known God.
