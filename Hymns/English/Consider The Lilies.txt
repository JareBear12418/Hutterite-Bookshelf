1. Consider the lilies, they don't toil nor spin,
But there's not a king with more splendor than them.
Consider the sparrows, they don't reap nor sow,
But they're fed by the master who watches them grow.

Chorus:
We have a heavenly Father above,
With eyes full of mercy and a heart full of love,
He really cares when your head is bowed low;
Consider the lilies, and then you will know.

2. May I introduce you to this friend of mine,
Who hangs out the stars, tells the sun when to shine;
He kisses the flowers each morning with dew,
But he's not too busy to care about you.
