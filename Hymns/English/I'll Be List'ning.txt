1. When the Savior calls I will answer,
When He calls for me I will hear;
When the Savior calls I will answer,
I'll be somewhere listening for my name.

Chorus:
I'll be somewhere listening,
I'll be somewhere listening,
I'll be somewhere listening for my name;
I'll be somewhere listening,
I'll be somewhere listening,
I'll be somewhere listening for my name.

2. If my heart is right when He calls me,
If my heart is right I will hear;
If my heart is right when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere listening for my name.

3. If my robe is white when He calls me,
If my robe is white I will hear;
If my robe is white when He calls me,
I'll be somewhere listening for my name.
