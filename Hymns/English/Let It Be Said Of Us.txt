1. Let it be said of us, that the Lord was our passion,
That with gladness we bore, every cross we were given,
That we fought the good fight, that we finished the course,
Knowing within us the power of the risen Lord.

Chorus: Let the cross be our glory and the Lord be our song,
By mercy made holy, by the Spirit made strong.
Let the cross be our glory and the Lord be our song,
Till the likeness of Jesus be through us made known;
Let the cross be our glory, and the Lord be our song.

2. Let it be said of us, we were marked by forgiveness,
We were known by our love and delighted in meekness,
We were ruled by His peace, heeding unity's call,
Joined as one body, that Christ would be seen by all.
