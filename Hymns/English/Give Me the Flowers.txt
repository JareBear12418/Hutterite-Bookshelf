1. In this world today while we're living
Some folks say the worst of us they can;
And when we are dead and in the casket,
They always slip some lilies in our hand.

Chorus:
Won't you give me the flowers while I'm living,
And let me enjoy them while I can;
Please, don't wait till I'm ready to be buried,
And then slip some lilies in my hand.

2. In this world is where we need our flowers
And a kind word to help us get along;
If you can't give me flowers while I'm living
Then please, don't throw them when I'm gone.
