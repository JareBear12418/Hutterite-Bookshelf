1. Source of life to wood and stream,
Sovereign Lord and gentle King.
More than we could ever dream;
You are beautiful.
Father to the fatherless,
Healer of our brokenness,
How you fill our emptiness;
You are beautiful.

Chorus:
Jesus, you are beautiful;
There is none to compare with you;
Jesus, you are beautiful,
And you show your love to me;
And it gives me grace to see
You are everything my heart desires;
You are beautiful

2. Son of God upon a cross,
Tasting death for all of us,
Reaching out when we were lost;
You are beautiful.
Risen Lamb upon the throne,
Roaring Lion coming soon,
Every eye will see it's true,
You are beautiful.
