1. Oh Lord, I have lived for many things,
But mostly I've been living for myself;
To walk your road is not an easy thing to do;
If you could die for me then I can live for you.

2. Oh Lord, I don't know the reason why-
You let them take your life just to give me mine;
All I know is the pure and simple truth:
If you could die for me then I can live for you.

Chorus: And if there were no cross, I would still be lost
In a world so dark and so confused.
Without the blood you shed my soul would still be dead,
And Jesus, I owe my life to you.

3. Oh Lord, I know I'm worth a lot-
'Cause when you bought my soul, you paid the highest price;
To walk your road is the least that I can do,
If you could die for me then I can live for you.
