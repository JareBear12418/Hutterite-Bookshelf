1. Young and fresh as the breezes in the mountain, or the lake,
We are building together singing free;
When the long night is over, we shall see the morning break,
On the time that is promised to be.

Chorus:
It's a new, new time, a time of joy and gladness,
A new, new land, free of suffering and sadness;
A new, new age, men shall live in unity,
In the Kingdom of the Lord that is promised to be.

2. We must not only fight against the evil of the world,
But be working for peace and purity;
To win justice and mercy, we must build and not destroy.
Build the land that is promised to be.

3. There's a plan for the building and it's truth is pure and strong,
Half a building shall ever empty be;
Unity is the watchword, love among us is the sign,
For the age that is promised to be.

4. Hands are working together, hearts are full of burning love,
Eyes are shining, we're singing joyfully;
As we work in obedience on the building for the Lord,
Of the Kingdom that is promised to be.
