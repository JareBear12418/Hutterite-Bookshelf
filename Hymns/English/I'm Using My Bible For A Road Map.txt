1. I'm using my Bible for a road map,
The children of Israel used it, too;
They crossed the Red Sea of destruction
For God was there to see them through.

Chorus:
There'll be no detours in heaven
No rough roads along the way;
I'm using my Bible for a road map,
My last stop is heaven some sweet day.

2. I'm using my Bible for a road map,
The ten commandments tell me what to do;
The twelve disciples are my road signs,
And Jesus will take me safely through.
