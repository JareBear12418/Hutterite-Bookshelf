1. Songs of praise unto Him who hath loved us,
With united heart we sing (with gratitude we sing;)
For all the mercies that daily surround us
In our lives we crown Him Lord and King;
Shepherd true, He is everlasting,
Guarding His own from every foe,
Day by day unto pastures leading
Where cooling waters flow.

Chorus:
Praise our ever - lasting King
(Praise our ev - er - lasting King)
Let the glad bells ring, let the whole world sing
(ring, ring, ring, sing, sing, sing,)
Until the echoes reach the sky,
(Until the ech - oes reach the sky,)
And angels unto men reply.

2. Songs of praise unto Him who hath loved us,
Daily our delight shall be (supreme delight shall be,)
He knows our way and He goes on before us
Saying I am with Thee, follow Me;
Strong to save, mighty to deliver,
No evil thing have we to fear
What can make us afraid? What danger
Smite us while He is near?
