1. There is but one real religion that redeems a sinners soul,
It's as timeless as the ages it never will grow old;
My Lord gave the key to Thomas, I'm the way, the truth, the life,
And the way has never changed since He spoke the word that night.

Chorus:
My religion's not old fashioned but it's real genuine,
Two and two make four today as it did in my Lord's time;
Modern days don't make a different you can't alter truth or time,
My religion's not old fashioned but it's real genuine.

2. In this world of wild confusion we are often led astray,
When we hear that word old fashioned when men speak of God today
My Lord doesn't deal in fashions. He's more timeless than the sea,
And His words still hold their power as they did in Galilee.

3. Some are prone to take the Bible and dilute the words of Christ,
They admit He came here one time, but will never make it twice,
Be not tempted by those prophets He said such men would arise
There is darkness in their teaching but there's light in Jesus Christ.
