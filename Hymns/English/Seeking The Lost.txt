1. Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating,
Wanderers on the mountain astray.
'Come unto me,' His message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking today.

Chorus: Going afarupon the mountain,
(Going afarupon the mountain)
Bringing the wanderer back again
(back again)
Into the fold,of my Redeemer,
(Into the foldof my Redeemer)
Jesus, the Lamb,for sinners slain.
(Jesus, the Lamb,for sinners slain)
2
Seeking the lost, and pointing to Jesus,
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore.
Leading them forth, in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life ever more.

3. Thus I would go on missions of mercy,
Following Christ from day unto day.
Cheering the faint and raising the fallen,
Pointing the lost, to Jesus, the Way.
