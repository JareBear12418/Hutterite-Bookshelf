1. Dear Lord, today two hearts have been united,
And to Thy throne we send this humble prayer;
Oh, Lord, look down with tenderness upon them
And bless the love these two have pledged to share.

Chorus:
Oh, mighty God, to Thee we pray,
Be their companion upon life's way;
Their comforter, their light to guide
Till safe they meet on yonder side.

2. Bless Thou their home with love and understanding,
Create within their hearts a love for Thee;
And as thro life they walk along together
Put Thou their hearts in perfect unity.

3. O give them grace to live above the trials,
And in temptation give them victory;
And on each cloud, Lord, put a silver lining
Put rainbows in the sky for them to see.

4. Hold now their hands as onward now they journey,
From home and friends and far across the land;
Be Thou their guide and give them Thy protection,
Till into heaven they walk hand in hand.
