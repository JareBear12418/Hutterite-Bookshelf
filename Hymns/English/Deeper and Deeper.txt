1. Deeper and deeper before Thee I bow,
Pour Thy abundance of grace on me now;
Master in meekness before Thee I fall,
Lord, in my life Thou shall be all in all.

Chorus:
Deeper and deeper, deeper in Thee,
Naught of this world shall satisfy me;
Down at Thy feet I do cast myself,
Lord Christ be my life and my full reward.

2. Deeper and deeper with Thee may I go,
Putting aside all this life and its woe;
I am unworthy of calling to Thee,
And yet I know Thou will answer my plea;

3. Deeper and deeper, then higher above,
Seek I, Lord Jesus, for Thy gracious love;
Only the way of the cross will be crowned,
Only in meekness, true joy may be found.
