1. Once I was bound by the chains of sin,
I had no hope and no peace within;
But Jesus came in my life one day, (in my life one day)
Now I can say that the Lord is real,
And His presence now I can truly feel,
For He has come in my life to stay. (in my life to stay)

Chorus: Truly I can say (Truly I can say)
That the Lord is real, (That the Lord is real)
For His presence now (Holy presence now)
In my heart I feel, (In my heart I feel)
Since He saved my soul (Since He saved my soul)
With His love appeal, (With His love appeal)
I'm so glad to tell you I know 'tis real. (Yes, I know 'tis real)

2. It was a glad happy day for me,
When He came in and my heart was freed.
I shouted, 'Glory,' to God most high, (Yes, to God most high)
He filled my soul with redeeming love,
Pointed out the way to the courts above,
Where I shall see Him some by and by. (happy by and by)

3. No longer now am I prone to stray,
For I am now in the glory way;
So sweetly walking with Christ my king. (with my Lord and King)
I'm headed for that eternal goal,
Heaven's happy home of the ransomed soul.
With saints and angels His praise to sing. (happy praise to sing)
