1. Now if you knew my Savior,
You wouldn't be as a foolish man;
Useless time, all your worldly pride,
And for Jesus you'd take your stand.

Chorus:
I'm waiting on that Glory bound train,
I'm waiting for that train to come in;
That same engineer that has been there for years
Is returning for me again.

2. Soon my waiting will be over,
And I'll be by the Savior side;
I'm ready to go and I want you to know
I'm taking a one-way ride.

3. Soon we'll hear that old whistle blowing
And we'll see it coming 'round the bend;
Let Jesus save your soul, put your name on the roll
And be ready when the train comes in.
