1. Every time I do a deed I shouldn't do
Every time I say a word I shouldn't say
Let me tell you what I do and this brings a blessing too
I just steal away somewhere and pray.

Chorus: I just steal away I just steal away
And I ask my blessed Lord to lead the way
I just steal away I just steal away
I just steal away somewhere and pray

2. I know God will hear and answer all my prayers
And I thank Him for His blessings everyday
If I'm burdened down with grief He will give my heart relief
If I steal away somewhere and pray.
(repeat chorus)
