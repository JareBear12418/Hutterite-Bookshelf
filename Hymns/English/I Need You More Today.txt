1. There are decisions I can't make on my own
And there are trials I can't face all alone
But you said you'd walk with me, down life's troubled road
And you said come unto me, I'll bear your heavy load.

Chorus: I need you more today than I did yesterday
Mountains are higher, rivers are wider
I need you more today than I did yesterday
Help me remember, I need you more today.

2. When I wake up in the morning, and I fear to face the day
Let me feel your gentle hand, leading the way
Yesterday has come and gone, with those trials far behind
But I'm ever learning Lord and everyday I find.
