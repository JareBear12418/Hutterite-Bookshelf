Chorus: Lord, make us instruments of your peace;
Where there is hatred let your love increase
Lord, make us instruments of your peace;
Walls of pride and prejudice shall cease,
When we are your instruments of peace.

1. Where there is hatred we will sow His love,
Where there is injury we will never judge,
Where there is striving we will speak His peace;
To the people crying for release
We will be His instruments of peace.

2. Where there is blindness we will pray for sight,
Where there is darkness we will shine His light,
Where there is sadness we will bear their grief;
To the millions crying for release
We will be His instruments of peace.
