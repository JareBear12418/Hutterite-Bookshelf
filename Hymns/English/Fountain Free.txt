1. There's a fountain free, 'tis for you and me,
Let us haste, O haste to the brink;
'Tis a fount of love from the source above,
And he bids us all freely drink.

Chorus:
Will you come to the fountain free?
(will you come)
Will you come? 'tis for you and me;
(will you come)
Thirsty soulhear the welcome call;
(thirsty soul)
'Tis a fountain open for all.

2. There's a living stream with a crystal gleam,
From the throne of life now it flows;
While the waters roll let the weary soul
Hear the call that forth freely goes.

3. There's a living well and its waters swell,
And eternal life they can give;
And we joyful sing, ever spring, O spring,
As we haste to drink and to live.

4. There's a rock that's cleft and no soul is left,
That may not its pure waters share;
'Tis for you and me and its stream I see,
Let us hasten joyfully there.
