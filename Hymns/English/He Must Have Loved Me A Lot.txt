1. He left the splendors of heaven for me,
And he took on the likeness of man.
He came to live in an ungodly world,
Though spotless, the Lamb with no sin.
All heaven's foundations were shaken that day,
But for changing his mind he could not.
Though he knew exactly, what he would go through;
Oh, he must have loved me a lot.

Chorus:
And how many tears, have I brought to his eyes;
I've hurt him more often than not.
Still infinite mercy responds to my cry,
Oh, he must have loved me a lot.

2. He went through the shame of a trial alone;
Through the darkness of death and the grave.
He went through the pain of denial and scorn,
The outcast and beggar to save.
If I had the power to turn back the time,
Make amends for the things I forgot,
A lifetime of goodness, could never atone;
Oh, he must have loved me a lot.
