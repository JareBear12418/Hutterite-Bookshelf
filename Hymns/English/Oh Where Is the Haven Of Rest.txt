1. Oh, where is the haven of rest for the soul?
The peace and contentment it seeks for its goal?
Can no place be found on this earth free from sin?
No city of refuge where safety we win?
No, no, no, no, not here below,
With Jesus above is the home that we know.

2. Oh, think of the heavenly joy of that rest,
With Jesus, among the great best of the blest,
Where we shall be welcomed with music and song
In light where the angels in seraphim throng;
Faith, faith, faith, faith, Faith giveth rest,
In peace and contentment and joy every blest.

3. From all earthly tumult and sorrow we flee,
With hearts full of longing, oh, Savior to Thee,
In all Thy great blessings we sit at Thy feet,
And share with the ransomed the fellowship sweet,
Home, home, home, home, No more to roam,
Grant us our Redeemer, this heavenly home.
