1. I heard a voice, (I heard a voice,)
For Paul and Silas were in jail,
Nobody dared (Nobody dared) Nobody dared to go near it;
(But when they prayed) they knew that God was by their side
(The jail house door) swung open wide.

Chorus:
When you believe you shall receive,
There's not a trouble or care that Jesus can't relieve;
For He is just the same today
All you have to do is trust and pray, believe
You just believe.

2. When Daniel sat) within the hungry lion's den,
(Nobody thought) that there was any hope for Him;
(But all night long) the lions never took a bite,
(God took away) their appetite.

3. (When David stood) before the giant with his sling,
(Goliath laughed) that such a cutie little thing;
(But David knew) his faith in God will stand the test,
(He flung the rock) God did the rest.
