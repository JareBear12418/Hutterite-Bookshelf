Chorus: I wanna rain and shine, both at the same time,
A blessing and a beacon that you'll provide,
To the fertile fields and barren plains.
Lord, I'll go in your name, rake, hoe or plow.
Show me how to plant the seeds and pull the weeds.
With the living water and a light divine, I'll rain and shine.

1. Lord, I want to be a blessing to a dry and thirsty soul,
Pouring out your love and let forgiveness grow.
Weary hearts will wither without refreshing water;
Showers come from you, but it's a vessel you can use.

2. This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine;
Someone may be watching, lost and alone tonight.
One little candle could light the way, I'd love to be the flame;
With your love to keep my heart aglow,
I can give a ray of hope.
