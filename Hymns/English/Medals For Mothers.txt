I dreamed mother walked up those heavenly stairs
And medals for mothers were given up there;
It mentioned the million things mom did for me,
Things I took for granted and never could be.

Chorus:
If there's medals for mothers
For all of the deeds they have done;
If there's medals for mothers
Mama you'll win everyone.

2. A medal of honor was pinned on her there,
A medal for patience and kind loving care;
A medal for duty she won up above,
But the biggest of all was the one for her love.
