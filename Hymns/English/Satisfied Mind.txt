1. You may seek all earth's pleasures;
You may seek wealth and gold.
And a friend when you're lonely,
Or for health when you're old.
But there's one thing for certain, that you'll never find,
A man without Jesus, with a satisfied mind.

Chorus:
A satisfied mind is a gift of our Lord,
True riches are found, in the wealth of his Word.
A satisfied mind is the soul's sweet reward.
Great treasures are found, in God's Holy Word.

2. You may dress in late fashions,
You may have lust and greed,
Seek for life's highest honor,
Men's favor, your creed.
You may search and you'll seek, but you'll never find,
A life without Jesus, and a satisfied mind.

3. You may joke as you gamble,
Curse and try everything.
Drink your wine and your whiskey,
As you rock 'n roll sing.
You may travel world's distance, but this you'll not find,
A man without Jesus, with a satisfied mind.
