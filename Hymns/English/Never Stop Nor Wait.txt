1. There's a right and a wrong way to press along,
And the right one you must take,
If you want a friend at your journey's end,
And meet Him there some day.

Chorus:
Never stop (nor wait) lest you be too late,
To inherit the golden crown,
If we walk (each day) in the gospel way,
And the words of God be found.

2. Never do good deeds for the praise of man,
Giving gold that they might see,
But in secret give, and in secret pray,
He'll reward you openly.

3. Do you love your neighbor as yourself?
Do you cheat him not in trade?
Would your conscience groan on tomorrows dawn
Should you meet him on the way.
