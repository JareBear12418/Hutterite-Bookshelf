1. O they say there'll be a judgment,
That it may come any day,
Will you be prepared for Jesus,
As He brightens up your way;
He will take the torch of glory,
And the Bible in His hands,
It's the microphone of Jesus over S A-V-E-D.

Chorus:
O that station's owned and operated by the soul of Jesus,
Won't you listen into station s-a-v-e-d;
If the road is dark and stormy,
And you cannot see the way?
Why not turn your dial to Jesus,
Won't you listen in today?

2. You get news direct from heaven,
From the gloryland on high,
Where there is no interference,
And no static in the sky;
All the programs are of happiness,
And never of despair,
It's the only radio station that is never off the air.

3. Each and everyone is welcome,
To the studio of Christ,
There'll be angels there to greet you,
Oh, they'll treat you very nice;
Here they do not charge admission,
It is free to one and all,
Won't you get in touch with Jesus,
Please do not neglect His call.
