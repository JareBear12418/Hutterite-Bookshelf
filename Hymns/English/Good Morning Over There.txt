1. Someday, here I know
That I will travel my last mile,
And on that day I'll fly away
From this old world in sight;
There's nothing that can hold me here
Soon glory I will share,
I'm gonna say, 'Goodnight down here
Good morning over there.'

Chorus:
Good night, good night to this old world,
I'm making my last round,
I'm heading now for Gloryland
Oh yes, I'm heaven bound;
This world is full of trouble
And I feel I've had my share,
I'm gonna say, 'Goodnight down here
Good morning over there.'

2. I hate to leave my dearest friends
The ones I truly love,
But I'll be waiting for them there
In heaven up above;
When they lay this body down to rest
Try holding back your tears,
Don't weep for me, cause I will be
Rejoicing over there.
