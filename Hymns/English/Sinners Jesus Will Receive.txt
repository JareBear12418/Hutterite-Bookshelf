1. Sinners Jesus will receive;
Sound the word of grace to all
Who the heav'nly pathway leave,
All who linger, all who fall.

Chorus:
Sing it o'er and o'er again;
(Sing it o'er again, sing it o'er again;)
Christ re - ceiv - eth sinful men;
(Christ receiveth sinful men, Christ receiveth sinful men;)
Make the mes - sage clear and plain:
(Make the message plain, Make the message plain)
Christ receiv - eth sinful men.
(receiveth sinful men.)

2. Come and He will give you rest;
Trust Him, for His Word is plain.
He will take the sinfullest;
Christ receiveth sinful men.

3. Now my heart condemns me not,
Pure before the law I stand;
He who cleansed me from all spot,
Satisfied its last demand.

4. Christ receiveth sinful men,
Even me with all my sin;
Purged from every spot and stain,
Heav'n with Him I enter in.
