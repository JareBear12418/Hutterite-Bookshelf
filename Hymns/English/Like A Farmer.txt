1. The farmer plows through fields of green,
And the blade of the plow is sharp and keen.
The farmer plows through fields of green,
And the blade of the plow is sharp and keen.
But the seed must be sown to bring forth grain;
Nothing is born without suffering and pain;
And God never plows in the soul of man
Without intention, purpose and plan.

2. So when you feel the plow's sharp blade,
Let not your heart be sorely afraid.
When you feel the plow's sharp blade,
Let not your heart be sorely afraid.
For like the farmer, God chooses a field
From which he expects an excellent yield.
Rejoice though your heart is broken in two;
God seeks to bring forth a rich harvest in you.
