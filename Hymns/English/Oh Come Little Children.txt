1. Oh, come little children, oh, come one and all
Oh, come to the manger in Bethlehem's stall;
And see the Lord Jesus asleep on the hay,
The little Lord Jesus was born Christmas Day.

2. He lies in a manger, the hay is his bed,
The stars high in heaven shine over his head;
And Mary and Joseph look down on the boy,
While shepherds and wisemen kneel down in their joy.

3. Now 'Glory to God' comes the song from on high,
And peace to all mankind we sing in reply;
Then come little children, be happy and gay,
For Jesus the Christ child was born Christmas Day.
