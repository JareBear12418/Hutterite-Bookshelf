1. On your blest wedding day, may the Lord guide your way,
And keep you in His loving arms.
As you join heart and soul, may your love ne'er grow cold,
And know of no danger or harm.

Chorus:
May you walk in a path of true love,
(May you walk in a path-way that's paved with true love,)
Paved down by angels above;
(Paved down by the angels above;
That is paved with God's silver and gold.
(That is paved with God's love of pure silver and gold.)
A love that's never cold.
(A love that will never grow cold.)

2. May the love that you share bring you joys blest and fair,
That blend with the heavenly hues.
Then when earth life is past, you'll be hearing at last
God whisper a lovesong for you.

3. May you glorify God in all that you do,
And both daily walk in His ways.
'Til you reach heaven's shore, where your trials are o'er,
And abide with the Lord evermore.
