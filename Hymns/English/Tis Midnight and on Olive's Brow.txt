1. 'Tis midnight; and on Olive's brow
The star is dimmed that lately shone;
'Tis midnight; in the garden, now,
The suff'ring Savior prays alone.

2. 'Tis midnight; and from all removed,
The Savior wrestles 'lone with fears;
E'en the disciple that He loved
Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.

3. 'Tis midnight; and for others' guilt
The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood;
Yet He that hath in anguish knelt
Is not forsaken by His God.

4. 'Tis midnight; and from heav'nly plains
Is borne the song that angels know;
Unheard by mortals are the strains,
That sweetly soothe the Savior's woe.
