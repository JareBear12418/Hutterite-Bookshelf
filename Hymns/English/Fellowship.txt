Chorus:
If we are walking in the light
As he is in the light,
Then we have fellowship
One with another,
My sisters and my brothers.
If we are walking in the light
As he is in the light,
Then truly our fellowship
Is with the Father,
And his Son Jesus Christ.

1. For real fellowship is in the Spirit of God,
It's not a barbecue, it's not a sewing club,
It's not a social game,
But we're so glad you came
To share our fellowship.

2. You might have fellowship
On a camping trip,
But a camping trip ain't fellowship;
If by the Spirit of God
You've been born of God,
Then you might have fellowship.

3. My brethren, these things have we declared unto you
That we might have fellowship
One with another and with the Father.
My brethren, these things that we have seen and heard
We declare now unto you,
That our fellowship might be in the Son of God.
