1. Life is like a mighty sea so tossed and driven,
Billows rise within the heart of every man.
For so many times we leave the heart to question;
I don't need to understand, just hold his hand.

Chorus:
I don't need to understand,
I just need to hold his hand;
I don't even need to ask the reason why.
For I know he'll make the way,
Through the night and thru the day;
I don't need to understand,
I just need to hold his hand.

2. When my life down here is through someday he'll call me,
To my home up there beyond the golden shore;
I'll look back review the path that lay before me;
I don't care to understand, anymore.
