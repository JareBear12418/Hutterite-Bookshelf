1. To Canaan's land I'm on my way,
Where the soul (of man) never dies;
My darkest night will turn to day,
Where the soul (of man) never dies.

Chorus: No sad farewells,
(Dear friends, there'll be no sad farewells,)
No tear dimmed eyes,
(There'll be no tear dimmed eyes,)
Where all is love,
(Where all is peace and joy and love,)
And the soul never dies.
(And the soul of man never dies.)

2. A rose is blooming there for me,
Where the soul (of man) never dies;
And I will spend eternity,
Where the soul (of man) never dies.

3. A love light beams across the foam,
Where the soul (of man) never dies;
It shines to light the shores of home;
Where the soul (of man) never dies.

4. My life will end in deathless sleep,
Where the soul (of man) never dies;
And everlasting joys I'll reap,
Where the soul (of man) never dies.

5. I'm on my way to that fair land,
Where the soul (of man) never dies;
Where there will be no parting hand,
Where the soul (of man) never dies.
