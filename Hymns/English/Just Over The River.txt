1. Just over the river, just over the river,
I'm told there's a city of God,
Its gates are of pearl and its streets are of gold,
And by glorified beings they're trod;
And Jesus my Savior has gone to the city,
A place for His own to prepare,
In the house of my Father, the mansion are many,
And one is awaiting me there.

Chorus:
Just over the river,
(Just over the river, just over the river,)
That beautiful city I'll see,
Just over the river,
(And Jesus my Savior has gone to make ready.)
A place in that city for me.

2. Just over the river, just over the river,
That city that knoweth no night,
It needeth no sun neither needeth the moon,
For the glory of God is it's light;
In that city the saved ones are waiting, our coming,
Expectant they stand on the shore,
Oh, when can I enter my mansion in Heaven?
A pilgrim to roam nevermore.

3. Just over the river, just over the river,
I'm told there's a city of God,
Where the feet of His children on street of pure gold,
Shall forever in His presence walk;
For Jesus my Savior has gone to the city
A place for His own to prepare,
In the house of my Father, the mansions are many,
And one is awaiting me there.
