1. I've never been to the place where Jesus was born;
I wasn't able to hold Him in my arms.
I've never seen Him but it don't make much difference you see,
Though I wasn't there, I know Jesus is living in me.

Chorus: For I've got something that makes me know that He's real;
I'm born of His Spirit and I know in my heart He lives.
The sacrifice for all men and His blood
cleansed me from all sin;
I wasn't there but I know that Jesus still lives.

2. I wasn't there when they led my dear Savior away;
On Calvary, they nailed Him to the cross that day.
From the manger to the cross to a lonesome ol' grave,
Jesus died but He rose the third day,
I wasn't there but I know that Jesus still lives.
