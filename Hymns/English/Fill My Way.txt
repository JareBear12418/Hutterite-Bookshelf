1. Let me walk, blessed Lord,
In the way Thou hast gone,
Leading straight to the land above.
Giving hope every day
To the sad and the lone
Fill my way, every day with love.

Chorus:
Fill my way, every day with love, (sweet love)
As I walk with the heavenly dove,
Let me go all the way,
Filled with God every day
Fill my way, every day with love.

2. Keep me close to the side
Of my Savior and Guide,
Let me never in darkness roam;
Keep my path free from wrath
And my soul satisfied,
Fill my way, everyday with love.

3. Soon this life will be o'er,
And I'll struggle no more,
But abide in my home above.
Help me keep my heart right
All the way to the shore,
Fill my way, every day with love
