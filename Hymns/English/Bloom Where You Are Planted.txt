1. How majestic when red roses, bloom profusely on a bush,
Or when golden buttercups,
brighten meadows green and lush.
And when pansies' upturned faces, imitate a smile or two,
What is there that is more lovely, than the violet's purple hue.

Chorus: Bloom where you are planted,
did you ever hear the phrase?
Do you think it possible; does it seem a cloudy maze?
God gives us many promises, and His word He does fulfill,
May I be as a rosebud, blooming in His holy will.

2. Now we all have storms in life, we meet up with wind and rain,
Some have higher heights to climb;
some think their life is vain.
Some are lonely, some have grief,
Some are crippled, some are maimed,
Others suffer many heartaches, deaf or blind, few are the same.

3. Seems to me that a message,
from these flowers I would gain,
If I want to be of use, and to bloom in Jesus' name;
Just to find a sweet contentment, in whatever God may bring,
That wherever I am planted, there my lips would sweetly sing:
