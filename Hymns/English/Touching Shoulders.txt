There's a comforting thought at the close of the day
When I'm discouraged, weary and confused.
A feeling takes hold of my searching soul
And tells me I'm so richly blessed
To have you here, knowing you care
Enough to tell me when I'm wrong again.
You always remind me, we dare not give up the fight.
I'm so glad I touched shoulders with you.

CH:Did you know you were strong?
Did you know you were my rock?
Did you know I was leaning on you?
Did you know I grow stronger and wiser because
I have always touched shoulders with you.

I can fly higher than an eagle soaring through the sky
When you guide me through the storms of life.
You're the wind beneath my wings sustaining me always.
I count on you, you are ever true.
I cannot go on without your love and care.
It fills my heart and soul and leads me a-right.
You always remind me, we dare not give up the fight.
I'm so glad I touched shoulders with you.

And I'm still touching shoulders with you.
