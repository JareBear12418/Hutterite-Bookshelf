1. I don't know how to say exactly how I feel,
And I can't begin to tell you what your love has meant,
I'm lost for words.

2. Is there a way to show the passion in my heart?
Can I express how truly great I think you are?
My dearest friend;
Lord, this is my desire, to pour my love on you

Chorus:
Like oil upon your feet,
Like wine for you to drink,
Like water from my heart,
I'll pour my love on you.
If praise is like perfume
I'll lavish mine on you
Till every drop is gone;
I'll pour my love on you.

(repeat second verse and chorus)
