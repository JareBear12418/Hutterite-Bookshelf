1. While strolling along in the country,
Reviewing the scenes new and old,
I found an old fashioned log cabin,
So beautiful there to behold;
A stranger was standing in silence,
His eyes firmly fixed on the door,
My heart ached in pity to see him.
For these were the words that he told.

Chorus: The sign it reads a log cabin for sale,
An old oaken bucket and well,
He returned to keep a log on the fire
And a light burning bright in the dell;
Many years an old couple did patiently wait,
For a boy whose last promise did fail,
Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more,
There's an old log cabin for sale.

2. A welcome I read on the floor mat,
An old braided rug by the door,
The hands of an angel had made it
With many a prayer prayed before;
In that old rocking chair she had waited
For one glimpse of him how she yearned.
But now he was standing in silence
Too late, yes, too late he returned.
