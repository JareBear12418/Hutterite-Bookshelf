1. Since Jesus freely did appear
To grace a marriage feast,
O Lord, we ask thy presence here,
To be a wedding guest.

2. Upon the bridal pair look down
Who now have plighted hands;
Their union with thy favor crown,
And bless the nuptial bands.

3. In purest love these souls unite,
That they with Christian care,
May make domestic burdens light,
By taking mutual share.

4. And when that solemn hour shall come,
And life's short space be o'er,
May they in triumph reach that home,
Where they shall part no more.
