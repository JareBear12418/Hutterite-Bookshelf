1. I came to God one night in prayer
With my heartaches and my care,
I prayed, 'Dear Father, here's my life I'm going thru;'
And since I prayed and Jesus came I have never been the same,
I'm glad I stayed down on my knees till I prayed thru.

Chorus:
I'll never forget that, wonderful hour,
I felt His power when I prayed thru;
All heaven came down and God's Glory abounded,
The angels resounded, when I prayed thru.

2. And now I'm His and He is mine
Blessed assurance so divine,
I'm feasting on the living word since I prayed thru;
I can't explain just how I feel
But praise God I know it's real,
Because I stayed down on my knees till I prayed thru.
