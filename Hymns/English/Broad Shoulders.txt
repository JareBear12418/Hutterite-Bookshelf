1. I took a long, long walk by the river,
Had a quiet peaceful talk with my Lord;
He found my heart heavy with troubles,
But our talk seemed to lighten my load.

Chorus:
My Jesus has broad shoulders,
His back is stronger than mine;
He was there the first time I called Him,
He'll be there any place, anytime.

2. Now it's true that I still got some troubles,
But since Jesus and I had our talk;
I've found peace of mind and contentment,
I'm so glad in His presence to walk.

3. So I'll keep on the right road to heaven,
For the way He showed me is so clear;
And no matter what happens tomorrow,
If I need Him I know He'll be there.
