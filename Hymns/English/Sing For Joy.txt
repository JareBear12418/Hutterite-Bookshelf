1. If we call to him he will answer us;
If we run to him he will run to us.
If we lift our hands he will lift us up;
Come now, praise his name all ye saints of God.

Chorus:
O sing (O sing) for joy
To God our strength.
O sing (O sing) for joy,
To God our strength, our strength.

2. Draw near to him he is here with us;
Give him your love he's in love with us.
He will heal our hearts, he will cleanse our hands;
If we rend our hearts he will heal our land.

(repeat verses 1 & 2 and chorus)
