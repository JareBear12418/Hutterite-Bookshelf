1. There is a place of commanded blessing
Where brethren in unity dwell,
A place where anointing oil is flowing,
And we live as one.

2. You have called us to be a body,
You have called us as friends,
Joined together in the bond of the Spirit,
Unto the end.

3. Father, we join with the prayer of Jesus,
As you are, so let us be one,
Joined together in unity and purpose,
All for the love of your Son.

Chorus:
We will break dividing walls,
We will break dividing walls,
We will break dividing walls in the name of your Son,
We will break dividing walls,
We will break dividing walls and we will be one.

4. Between the north and the south,
Between the east and the west,
Those walls they're coming down.
Between the black and white,
And the orange and the green,
Those walls they're coming down.

5. Between the fathers and sons,
Between the brothers and sisters,
Those walls they're coming down.
Between the young and the old,
And traditions grown cold,
Those walls they're coming down.
