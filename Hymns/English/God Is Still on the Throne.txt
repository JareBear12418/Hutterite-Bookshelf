1. Have you started for, glory and heaven,
Have you left this old world far behind;
In your heart is the Comforter dwelling,
Can you say 'Praise the Lord, He is mine;'
Have the ones that once walked on the highway,
Gone back, and you seem all alone?
Keep your eyes on the prize, for the home in the skies,
God is still on the throne.

Chorus:
(God is still on the throne,)
And He will remember his own;
Though trials may press us and burdens distress us,
He never will leave us alone;
(God is still on the throne,)
He never forsaketh His own;
His promise is true, He will not forget you,
God is still on the throne.

2. Burdened soul, is your heart growing weary
With the toil and the heat of the day;
Does it seem that your path is more thorny,
As you journey along on life's way?
Go away and in secret before Him
Tell your grief to the Savior alone;
He will lighten your care, for He still answers prayers,
God is still on the throne.

3. You may live in a tent or a cottage,
Unnoticed by those who pass by;
But a mansion for you He is building
In that beautiful city on high;
It will outshine the wealth and the splendor
Of the richest on earth we have known;
He's the Architect true, and He's building for you;
God is still on the throne.

4. He is coming again, is the promise
To disciples when He went away;
In like manner as He has gone from you,
You will see Him returning some day;
Does His tarrying cause you to wonder,
Does it seem He's forgotten His own?
His promise is true, He is coming for you;
God is still on the throne.
