1. My heart was distressed 'neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And lo in the pits where my sins dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.

Chorus:
He brought me out of the miry clay
He set my feet on the rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah.

2. He gave me a song 'twas a new song of praise,
By day and by night it's sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing I'm happy and free,
I'll praise my Redeemer who has rescued me.
