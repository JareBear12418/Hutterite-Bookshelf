1. 'All things are ready,' come to the feast!
Come, for the table now is spread;
Ye famishing, ye weary, come,
And thou shalt be richly fed.

Chorus: Heartheinvitation,
(Hear the invitation, whosoever will)
Comewhosoeverwill,
(Hear the invitation, whosoever will)
Praise Godforfullsalvation,
(Praise God for full salvation, whosoever will)
For whosoever will.

2. 'All things are ready,' come to the feast!
Come, for the door is open wide;
A place of honor is reserved
For you at the Master's side.

3. 'All things are ready,' come to the feast!
Come, while He waits to welcome thee;
Delay not while this day is thine,
Tomorrow may never be.

4. 'All things are ready,' come to the feast!
Leave ev'ry care and worldly strife;
Come, feast upon the love of God,
And drink everlasting life.
