Chorus:
Oh, just to have you, Lord,
Just to have you
Is worth all the world,
And every trial I go through;
I'll journey on, Lord,
Though we're just a few;
For it means everything, Lord,
Just to have you.

1. How can I fall by the wayside now?
How can I fail to follow him now?
Jesus is leading each step of the way;
And it means everything, Lord,
Just to have you.

2. Why should I murmur when things go wrong?
Why does it seem that l'm left all alone?
Jesus is leading each step of the way;
And it means everything, Lord,
Just to have you.
