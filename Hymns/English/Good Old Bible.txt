1. I believe that Father Adam
Was the first created man,
That Eve was made his wife
According to the Makers plan;
They lost their home in Eden
The Lord they did offend,
I believe the good old Bible,
From beginning to the end.

2. I believe that Master Abel
Was slain by Master Cain,
That Noah did go in the ark,
To get out of the rain;
I believe that little David
Slew Goliath and his men,
I believe the good old Bible,
From beginning to the end.

3. I believe the Hebrew children,
Walked into the burning fire;
That Ananias was struck dead,
Because he was a liar;
I believe that Father Daniel
Walked into the lion's den;
I believe the good old Bible,
From beginning to the end.

4. I believe the blessed Master
Turned: the water into wine;
As pure and sweet and harmless
As the grapes upon the vine.
All other wines are mockery
The scriptures do contain,
And I believe the good old Bible,
From beginning to the end.
