1. I walked one day along a country road,
And there a stranger journeyed too,
Bent low beneath the burden of His load;
It was the cross of Christ I knew.

Chorus: 'Take up thy cross and follow me,'
I hear the blessed Savior call.
How can I make a lesser sacrifice,
When Jesus gave His all?

2. I cried, 'Lord Jesus,' and He spoke my name,
I saw His hands all bruised and torn;
I stooped to kiss away the marks of shame;
The shame for me that He had borne.

3. 'Oh, let me bear thy cross, dear Lord;' I cried,
And lo, a cross for me appeared,
The one forgotten, I had cast aside,
The one so long that I had feared.

4. My cross I'll carry till the crown appears;
The way I journey soon will end
Where God Himself shall wipe away all tears,
And friend hold fellowship with friend.
