On a quiet summer's day, long ago and far away,
A little girl was kneeling by a grave.
As I stood there by her side, she was gazing at the sky.
Unto the Lord these words I heard her say:

CH: Oh Lord, please tell me do, why You took my mom with You?
Why on earth am I left all alone?
I loved her didn't You see, cause she was so good to me.
She always taught me what was right from wrong.

I remember her one day, when she taught me how to pray,
And as for favour took me on her knee.
That's why I'm kneeling here, my prayers dear Lord, do hear.
So tell me Lord, why mama went away?

Since mother has closed her eyes, everyday dear Lord, I cry.
For there's no one to care for me you see.
For the days they seem so long, when on earth you have no home.
So tell me Lord, why mama went away.
