1. A wreath of roses was placed on his grave,
And while he was living, there were things that he craved.
His life as a pauper was so very dim;
He needed the flowers while he could enjoy them.

Chorus: Don't scatter roses after I'm gone,
Give them to me while I carry on;
Now how I need them to help me along;
Don't scatter roses after I'm gone.

2. Many times he was hungry, but you passed him by,
He needed your help then but you didn't try;
To help him when needing to carry on,
Now you give him flowers after he's gone.
