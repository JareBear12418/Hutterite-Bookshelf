CH:Let's regain the garden, the beautiful garden
We lost long ago through sin.
Let's regain the garden, the beautiful garden.
With open arms God will welcome you in.

Long ago there was a garden,
A beautiful garden
That we all want to see someday.
It was made by Him above
Just for you and me to love,
And someday we'll live in that garden.

If we regain the garden
To live with our Saviour
Who bled and died for our sins,
If we serve Him everyday
Then He'll take us away
To our home in that beautiful garden.
