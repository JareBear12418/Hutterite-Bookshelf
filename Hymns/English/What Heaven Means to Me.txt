1. A country where no twilight shadows deepen
Unending days and night shall never be;
A city where no storm clouds ever gather,
All this is just what heaven means to me.

Chorus:
What will it be when we get over yonder,
And join the throng upon the glassy sea;
To greet out loved ones and crown Christ forever,
All this is just what heaven means to me.

2. A place where there is no misunderstanding,
And from all enmity and strive we're free;
No unkind words which from the hearts are spoken,
All this is just what heaven means to me.

3. And when at last I see the face of Jesus,
From whose image all others loves all flee;
And when they crown Him Lord of all of Eden,
All this is just what heaven means to me.
