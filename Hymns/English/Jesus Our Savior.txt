1. Jesus, our Savior, kind and good,
Was humbly born in a stable rude;
The friendly beasts around Him stood,
Jesus, our Savior, kind and good.

2. 'I,' said the donkey so shaggy and brown,
'I carried His mother uphill and down
I carried her safely to Bethlehem town'
'I,' said the donkey so shaggy and brown.

3. 'I,' said the cow all white and red,
'I gave Him my manger for His bed,
I gave Him my hay to pillow His head,'
'I,' said the cow all white and red.

4. 'I,' said the sheep with a curly horn,
'I gave Him my wool for His blanket warm,
He wore my coat on Christmas morn,'
'I,' said the sheep with a curly horn

5. 'I,' said the dove from the rafters high,
'I cooed Him to sleep, my mate and I
We cooed Him to sleep, so He would not cry,'
'I,' said the dove from the rafters high.

6. Thus every beast by some good spell,
In the stable dark was glad to tell,
Of the gift he gave to Immanuel,
Of the gift he gave to Immanuel.
