Come, ye sinners lost and hopeless.
Jesus blood can make you free.
For He saved the worst among you
When He saved a wretch like me.

CH:And I know, yes, I know.
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean.
And I know, yes, I know.
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean.

To the faint He giveth power.
Through the mountain makes a way.
Findeth water in the desert.
Turns the night to golden day.

In temptation He is near me.
Holds the power of hell at bay.
Guides me to the path of safety.
Gives me grace for every day.
