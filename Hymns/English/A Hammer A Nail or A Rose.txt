1. We don't think of the thorns in the roses,
But we look at the flower instead;
But I believe Jesus knew,
The pain He'd go through,
When they placed the thorns on His head.

2. And when we think of the nail and the hammer,
We can vision the things we can build;
But for Jesus these two,
Could be the kind they would use,
For the cross on Calvary's hill.

3. Every time He picked up a hammer,
I believe He thought of the plan;
And when He saw a nail
He remembered well,
Of the one to be drove in His hand.

4. And when He passed by the rose in the garden,
And saw the thorns, now don't you suppose;
Jesus thought of the cross,
Every time that he saw,
A hammer, a nail or a rose.
