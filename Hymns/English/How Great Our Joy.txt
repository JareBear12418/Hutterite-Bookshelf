1. While by the sheep we watched at night,
Glad tidings brought an Angel bright.

Chorus:
How great our joy! Great our joy!
Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy!
Praise we the Lord in heav'n on high!
Praise we the Lord in Heav'n on high!

2. There shall be born so he did say,
In Bethlehem a Child today.

3. There shall the Child lie in a stall,
This Child who shall redeem us all.

4. This gift of God we'll cherish well,
That ever joy our hearts shall fill.
