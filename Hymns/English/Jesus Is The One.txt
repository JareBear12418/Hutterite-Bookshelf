1. When the day is dark before you,
And the clouds are hanging low;
There is One that watches o'er you,
Everywhere that you may go.

Chorus:
Jesus is the one, yes, He's the only One,
Let Him have His way until the day is done;
As He speaks you know dark clouds will have to go,
Just because He loves you so.

2. When you are sad and lonely,
Life is but an empty tomb;
Breathe a prayer to Jesus only,
He will drive away your gloom.

3. When you come to cross the river,
He will be your friend and guide;
You may be with Him forever,
Over on the other side.
