1. There is a dwelling place I know,
'A house, not made with hands',
Prepared for those who love the Lord,
And follow His commands.

Chorus:
That promised land, (That promised land;)
From Pisgah's top (from Pisgah's top)
By faith I now behold!
(By faith I now behold, by faith I now behold!)
It's glitt'ring tow'rs (It's glitt'ring tow'rs)
in beauty rise (in beauty rise)
Above the streets (Above the streets) of gold.

2. No night is there, no clouded day,
No blighting winds of pain;
But everlasting joy and peace,
Unbroken, rule and reign.

3. There we shall meet with those we loved,
And lost upon the way;
Where no goodbyes are ever heard,
Where none shall ever stray.

4. From never-ending toil and care,
Thro' His redeeming grace,
How sweet 'twill be to enter there,
And meet Him face to face!
