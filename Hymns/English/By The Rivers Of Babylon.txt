1. By the rivers of Babylon, - Where we sat down,
There we wept, - When we remembered Zion.

2. Let the wicket carry us away, captivity, -
Requiring of us a song,
Now how shall we sing the Lord's song - In a strange land.

3. Let the words of our mouth - And the meditation of our heart
Be acceptable in thy sight, - Here tonight.
