1. As now you start your wedded life
Upon this earth together,
May God surround you with his love,
And bless you now and ever.

Chorus:
Together now, you'll share your joys,
Together now, you'll share your tears.
Together now, you'll walk along,
With Jesus Christ together.

2. May your home be a peaceful place
Where each is treasured dearly,
Where hearts are light and free and pure
And God's love shows so clearly.

3. When trials come just look to Christ,
He has the answer for each one;
Together then you'll face the foe
Until your journey's done.
