1. I have found the way
That leads to endless day,
Yonder in the gloryland;
And the road is bright,
For Jesus is the light,
And I hold His guiding hand.

Chorus:
I have found the way,
(I have found the way, I have found the glory way,)
I have found the way,
(I have found the way, I have found the gospel way,)
Glo - - - ry hallelujah,
(Glory hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,)
I have found the way.
(I have found the way, I've found the way, I've found the way)

2. I will never fear,
While Jesus is so near,
I will bravely meet the foe;
Happy songs I'll sing,
In honor to the King,
And to glory onward go.

3. To the journey's end,
Led by a faithful Friend,
Nevermore in sin to roam;
By the way called straight,
I'll reach the golden gate
Of the soul's eternal home
