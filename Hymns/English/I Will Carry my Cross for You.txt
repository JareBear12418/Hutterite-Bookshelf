1. Most of my life
I traveled down the road of my own choosing
You taught if a man saves his own life.
His Life he'll be losing
What profit can a man really know?
If he gains this whole world
Yet loses his soul

Chorus: I will carry my cross for you
I'll walk in your footsteps my whole life through
I'll do anything you will ask me to do
Jesus I will carry my cross for you.

2. They cursed you, they spit on you
Beat you and mocked you on the street
They drove those cold steel spikes
Through your hands and your feet
They thrust that spear into your side
I wanna live for you,
Cause it was for me you died
