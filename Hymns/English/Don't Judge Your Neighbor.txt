1. I've made mistakes the same as you,
I have sinned as we all do,
I can't name them one by one
You must be judged by the things you have done.

Chorus:
Don't judge your neighbor,
Don't judge your neighbor,
You're not the one to say he's wrong;
Clean out your own house,
Sweep out your own house,
There'll be a great Judgment Day before long.

2. No one's free from sin, this we know,
For in the Bible it tells us so,
Love everyone as God loves you
Don't harm your neighbor it's the wrong thing to do.

3. When you see a brother fall by the way,
A heartful of sin forgotten how to pray;
Never condemn him, his heart will obey
He must be judged on that great Judgment Day.
