1. Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
Anywhere He leads me in this world below,
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade,
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

Chorus:
Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

2. Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own,
Tho' His hand may lead me over drearest ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

3. Anywhere with Jesus, over land and sea,
Telling souls in darkness of salvation free,
Ready as He summons me to go or stay,
Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way.

4. Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the dark'ning shadows round about me creep,
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
