Here's my promise to you angel mother;
I will follow the footsteps of my dad.
I will always remember you mother,
As a best friend that I ever had.

CH:As I go to my home angel mother,
I can feel your sweet love everywhere.
How I long to just kneel by your bedside,
For I feel you are near me in prayer.

In my dreams you return angel mother,
Me your child, you have left in his steps.
And you'd tell me the sweet life of daddy
As you rocked in your old rocking chair.

I will follow the prayers that you taught me
As I travel this pathway alone.
I will walk in that path straight and narrow,
And I'll meet you in that heavenly home.
