1. When I look at you I realize - The little that I know.
When I look at you I realize - How far I have to go.
Oh, my mind cannot conceive the thought,
Of why you loved me so.
When I'm so far from what you are
And I seem to move so slow.

Chorus: You didn't have to love me, but you did;
You didn't have to heal me, but you did;
You didn't have to die on Calvary for me,
But you did, but you did.
You didn't have to save me, but you did,
Or sent your Spirit to sway me, but you did,
You didn't have to love me, save me, heal me,
But you did.

2. When others look at me, I hope they'll see
Reflections there of you.
When others look at me, I hope that they
Will want to know you too.
For if they can't see your love in me,
Then I've failed in what I do.
Though I'm so far from what you are,
I'm becoming more like you.
