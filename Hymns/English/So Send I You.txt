So send I you, to labor unrewarded.
To serve unpaid, unloved, unsought, unknown.
To bear rebuke, to suffer scorn and scoffing
so send I you, to toil for me alone.

So send I you, to leave your life's ambition
To die to dear desire, self-will resign
To labor long, and love, where men revile you
So send I you, to lose your life in mine.

So send I you, to hearts made hard by hatred
To eyes made blind because they will not see
To spend, though it be blood, to spend and spare not
So send I you, to taste of Calvary.

As the father has sent me, so send I you.'
