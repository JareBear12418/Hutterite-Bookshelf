1. I have started for a city on that bright eternal shore,
Where the saints of God shall gather and live on forevermore,
It's the land of love and purity, land where my processions lie,
And I'm bound for the land of Canaan when I die.

Chorus:
Oh! yes, I'm bound for the land of Canaan,
(Bound for the land of Canaan, yes, I am.)
By the power of the grace of God I surely am gay,
(Love of God .... I am gaining ground from happy days,)
From happy days with all the ransom I'll stand,
And sing His praise way over in Canaan happy land.

2. I have turned my back on Egypt, with it's bondage and despair,
And by faith the land of Canaan I'm determined to be there,
Not a bird can ever harm me, I am happy all the day,
And I'm bound for the land of Canaan some sweet day.

3. Oh! land of rest eternal where the living waters flow,
Everyday I'm one day nearer to its portals this I know;
Some sweet morning I'll be singing glory, glory to the Lamb,
And I'm bound for the land of Canaan, yes, I am.
