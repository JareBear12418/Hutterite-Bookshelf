1. Deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus,
Daily let me go;
Higher, higher in the school of wisdom
More of grace to know.

Chorus:
O deeper yet, I pray (Deeper yet, I pray;)
And higher every day (Higher every day.)
And wiser, blessed Lord, (Wiser, blessed Lord,)
In Thy precious holy Word.

2. Deeper, deeper, blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still;
Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus,
And His perfect will.

3. Deeper, deeper! Though it cost hard trials
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

4. Deeper, deeper, every day in Jesus,
Till all conflict past;
Finds me conqueror, and in His own image
Perfected at last.
