1. Humble me, humble me,
That I might receive you, Lord.
Oh, just humble my heart,
That I may feel your presence
Very close to me.

2. Humble me, humble me,
That I may confess all my faults,
And wait for you,
Till your cleansing stream
May flow through me.

3. Humble me, humble me,
And search every place in my heart,
Till your perfect will
Is finished and done in me;
Lord, lift me into you.
