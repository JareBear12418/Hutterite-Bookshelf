I hear a low faint voice ahead
A calling from the dead.
It comes from that poor orphan child that must be clothe and fed. (3)

CH: Saviour, lead them by the hand.
Gently lead them by the hand.
Saviour, lead them by the hand.
Till they all reach their journey's end.

They call them orphan children now;
Poor orphan boys and girls.
Who once had mother's loving hands, to smooth their golden curls. (3)

But now we see those lovely curls
Hang careless down their brow.
They say to us, 'my papa's dead and I've no mother now.'¬ù (3)

0h Saviour, every orphan bless
Wherever they may roam.
Bless every hand that lends them aid and bless the orphan home. (3)
