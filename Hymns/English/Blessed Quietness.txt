1. Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us forever,
Makes the trusting heart His home.

Chorus:
Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
Blest assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea Jesus spoke to me,
And the billows cease to roll!

2. Ev'rything is turned to gladness,
All around this glorious Guest,
Banished unbelief and sadness,
All is perfect peace and rest.

3. Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Spirit given,
Falls upon us from on high.

4. What a wonderful salvation,
Where we always see His face!
What a peaceful habitation,
What a quiet resting place!
