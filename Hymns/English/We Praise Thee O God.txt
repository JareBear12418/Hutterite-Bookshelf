1. We praise Thee, O God, for the Son of Thy love,
For Jesus who died, and is now gone above.

Chorus:
Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Thine the glory;
Revive us again.

2. We praise Thee, O God, for Thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior, and scattered our night.

3. All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins, and has cleansed ev'ry stain.

4. All glory and praise to the God of all grace,
Who has bought us and sought us and guided our ways.

5. Revive us again: fill each heart with Thy love;
May each soul be rekindled with fire from above.
