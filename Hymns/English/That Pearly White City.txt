1. In the beautiful land where it's always springtime
And the flowers bloom on and on;
Where the hearts always sing, with music sublime,
And we sing around that beautiful throne.

Chorus:
In that beautiful city (That pearly white city,)
I'm longing to be, (Yes, I'm longing to be,)
To live there forever, (Forever and ever,)
With Jesus who died for me.
Where none will be weary, (Downhearted nor dreary)
Where none will be lonesome, (Will be lonesome, I know)
I'm dreaming again, (Oh yes, I'm dreaming today)
Of that beautiful city of gold.

2. Where the storm never rises in the heavenly sky,
And we hear not the thunder roll;
And the burning tears roll not from their eyes,
For they weep not on the blissful shore.
