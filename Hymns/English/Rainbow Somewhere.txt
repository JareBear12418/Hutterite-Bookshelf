1. Sometimes you think your world is falling in,
But God is faithful, He said He'd keep us till the end.
And when the storm around me rages,
He reassures He's standing near,
And I can see a rainbow forming,
The sun is shining through my tears.

Chorus: There's got to be a rainbow somewhere,
The storm is coming to an end.
There's got to be a rainbow somewhere,
I feel the victory again.
And when I grow a little weary,
I turn my eyes upon the sky.
There's got to be a rainbow somewhere,
I feel the storm is passing by.

2. If you are wondering what you're going through,
And you are wondering what you're gonna do;
Well let me tell you that I've been there,
And though you may not understand,
If you'll just put your trust in Jesus,
Soon you'll see that mercy stand.
