1. I'm following Jesus one step at a time,
I live for the moment in His love divine;
Why think of tomorrow? just live for today,
I'm following Jesus each step of the way.

2. The pathway is narrow, but He leads me on,
I walk in His shadow, my fears are all gone;
My spirit grows stronger each moment, each day,
For Jesus is leading each step of the way.
