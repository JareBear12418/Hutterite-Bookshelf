1. When justice called for a payment for sin,
No one worthy could be found among men;
But the precious Son of God, with the cross and thorny crown,
Paid the debt with the blood of the Lamb.

Chorus:
Paid in full by the blood of the Lamb,
Free from sin, free to live now I am;
And it reads on the page, where my sins were written down,
'Paid in full by the blood of the Lamb.'

2. Oh! How great was the debt that I owed,
Bound to pay for the seeds I had sown;
But in Jesus, my Lord, a great treasure I have found,
I'm redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.
