1. He could have called ten thousand angels
To deliver Him that day.
But He hung there in all His anguish,
To prepare, for me, a way.

Chorus: It wasn't nails that held Him to the tree,
Nor the angry crowd that cried, 'Crucify.'
For when Jesus died upon Calvary,
It was love that held Him there.

2. Oh, what love beyond all measure,
That He'd give His life for me.
And I'm so glad that one day in glory,
His blessed face I'll see.

3. Everyday I'll tell the story,
Of His precious love for me.
How He bled and died on Calvary,
There to prove His love for me.
