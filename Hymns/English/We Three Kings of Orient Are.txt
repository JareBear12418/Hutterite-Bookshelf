1. We three Kings of Orient are:
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star.

Chorus:
O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect Light.

2. Born a king on Bethlehem's plain:
Gold I bring to crown Him again,
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign.

3. Frankincense to offer have I:
Incense owns a Deity nigh;
Prayer and praising, all men raising,
Worship Him, God on high.

4. Myrrh is mine: its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom
Sorr'wing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.

5. Glorious now behold Him arise;
King and God and Sacrifice;
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Earth to heav'n replies.
