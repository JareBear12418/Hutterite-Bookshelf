1. O holy night the stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth,
Long lay the world in sin and sorrow pining;
Till He appear'd and the soul felt its worth,
A thrill of hope the weary world restores
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

Chorus:
Fall on your knees! O hear the angels voices!
O night divine! O night, When Christ was born,
O night divine! O night, O night, divine!

2. Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand,
So fed by light of a star so sweetly gleaming,
Then came the wise men from Orient land;
To see the King who made earth's lowliest choices,
Yea chose His throne a manger all forlorn.
