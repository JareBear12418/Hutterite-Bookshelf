1. There are many things in life
That I cannot understand,
Yet the good Lord blessed the labor,
Of these two hard working hands;
And when all my toil is over,
And I'm laid beneath the sod,
Then these hands of mine,
Shall touch the hands of God.

Chorus:
There'll be a welcome there for me
Far beyond the crystal sea;
And I'll hold the hands
That Calvary's nail have scarred;
Then I'll enter through the gates,
Walk on streets the saints 'have trod;
Then these hands of mine,
Shall touch the hands of God.

2. Many times these hands have failed Him,
But He's kept me by His grace,
Even tho' sometimes in kindness
He had applied the chastening rod;
But I'm going home tomorrow
And I'll see Him face to face;
Then these hands of mine,
Shall touch the hands of God
