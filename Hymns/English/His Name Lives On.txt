1. There is a name, a name above all others,
A name that's stood the endless test of time;
That name has changed the lives of untold millions,
That name is Jesus and this Jesus is mine.

Chorus:
His name lives on and shall live on forever,
While kings and kingdoms shall all pass away;
He is a Lord of all, a King of all creation,
The name of Jesus is living on today.

2. Some men have tried to blot His name from history,
Denying all the great things He has done;
They have cursed His name and said there was no Calvary,
But through it all His name still lives on.
