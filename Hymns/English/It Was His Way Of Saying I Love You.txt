Chorus:
When he traveled the road to Mount Calvary,
To complete the painful task he came to do;
When he let them nail him to the cross,
It was his way of saying, 'I love you.'

1. Salvation was his purpose,
For this our Lord would spend his lifetime through;
When he let them place the thorns on his head,
It was his way of saying, 'I love you.'

2. Within the halls of Pilate,
Compassion was the tone of voice he used;
When he let them put the stripes on his back,
It was his way of saying, 'I love you.'
