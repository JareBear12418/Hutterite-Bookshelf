1. I've found the Lord and He is mine,
He won me by His love
I'll serve Him all my years of time
And dwell with Him above.

Chorus: His yoke is easy, His burden is light
I've found it so, I've found it so
His service is my sweetest delight
His blessings overflow.

2. No other Lord but Christ I know
I walk with Him alone
His streams of Love forever flow
Within my heart His throne.

3. He's dearer to my heart than life,
He found me lost in sin,
He calmed the sea of inward strife,
And bid me come to Him.

4. My crown recoiled before the cross
And Satan whispered there
Thy gain will not replace the loss,
His yoke is hard to bear.
