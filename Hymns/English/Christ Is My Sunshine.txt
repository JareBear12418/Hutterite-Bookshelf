1. When I was down and needed someone,
Someone to keep me every day;
'Twas then and there, that I found my Jesus
And I'm so glad that He came my way.

Chorus:
Christ is my sunshine, my only sunshine,
He makes me happy, when skies are gray;
He changed my life, and my ways completely
So please, don't take my sunshine away.

2. I'm happy now with Jesus near me
A friend is He, a friend indeed,
The worldly friends may all forsake me,
Jesus will be all that I need.
