1. It's really dark and cold tonight,
And I'm so tired and all alone,
I see no ray of hope in sight;
Oh Lord, why did you ever make night?

Chorus: I made the night so you would trust in me.
I made the night so you would place your hand in mine.
I made the night so in the early morning,
You could see my sun rise and shine.

2. My fears and doubts seem real when it's dark,
And all my faith seems vain in the night.
But I can feel the warmth of your love;
Oh Lord, I can make it through the night.

3. Now as I place my trust in you,
And I can see the first rays of dawn,
And I know that you are with me;
Oh Lord, I'm so glad you made the night.
