1. Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
Which before the cross I spend;
Life and health and peace possessing
From the sinner's dying Friend.

2. Here I'll sit forever viewing
Mercy's streams in streams of blood,
Precious drops my soul bedewing,
Plead and claim my peace with God.

3. Truly blessed is this station,
Low before His cross to lie;
While I see divine compassion
Floating in His languid eye.

4. Here it is I find my heaven,
While upon the Lamb I gaze,
Love I much - I've much forgiven;
I'm a miracle of grace.

5. Love and grief my heart dividing,
With my tears His feet I bathe;
Constant still in faith abiding,
Life deriving from His death.

6. May I still enjoy this feeling,
In all need to Jesus go,
Prove His wounds each day more healing,
And Himself more deeply known.
