1. Let me be as your lamb, help me know who I am
Open up my mind like a child
Touch my heart, touch my soul,
blessed Jesus make me whole
Let me live my life living in the name of love.

Chorus: Living in the name of love
Living in the name of love
I live my life praising the Lord above
Living in the name of love
Living in the name of love
Praise God I'm living in the name of love.

2. Give me strength to go on, 'til the day that I'm called home
To the everlasting land beyond the sun
Put your word on my tongue, Lord and let your will be done
Let me live my life living in the name of love.
