You make my heart a garden filled with flowers
And green grass like carpet kissed by the morning dew.
You blessed the seeds of love I'd sow,
Warmed my heart so they can grow.
Now shelter me in Your arms, Lord,
Cause the storm is passing through.

CH:Walk through the garden of my heart, calm the storm, Lord.
Lest the pretty roses fail to bloom again.
Make the raging wind a gentle breeze,
Let me feel the sunshine, please, Lord, walk
Through the garden of my heart.

I can bring the water to the roses,
And plant the seeds of kindness so the bitter weeds can't grow.
But I can't cause the rain to fall
On a dry and thirsty soil.
And I can't calm the storm, Lord,
Nor the angry winds that blow.
