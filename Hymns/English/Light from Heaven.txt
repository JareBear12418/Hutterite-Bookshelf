1. You're in the darkness your soul is reaching
For any promise you can hold on to
But soon you'll see just what God is teaching
The light from heaven will come breaking through.

Chorus:
For the sun is always shining
Though the clouds may hide its view
You may not see the silver lining
But any day now, someway and somehow
The light from heaven will come breaking through.

2. Your spirit's heavy, you heart is broken
You've forgotten that the sky is blue
Just wait before him, the door will open
The light from heaven will come breaking through.

3. The world around us is getting darker
But we know the word of God is true
Before Christ's coming times will be harder
Then the light from heaven will come breaking through.
