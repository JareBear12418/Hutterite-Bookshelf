1. When the storm clouds rise and it grieves my soul,
 Stand by me, (stand by me) stand by me. (stand by me)
When the storms draw nigh and the billows roll,
Stand by me, (stand by me) stand by me. (stand by me)

Chorus: Stand by me, when the day grows dark and long,
Stand by me, if I lose my song.
Till I reach heaven's door, where our troubles are o'er,
There to be forevermore, stand by me. (stand by me)

2. If tomorrow should bring me pain and grief,
Stand by me, (stand by me) stand by me. (stand by me)
Underneath your wings let me find relief,
Stand by me, (stand by me) stand by me. (stand by me)
