1. Jesus came unto His own,
But His own received Him not;
He healed the sick and caused the blind to see;
He made the lame to walk again
And He set the captive free,
But they turned their backs upon the Lord
And nailed Him to the tree.

Chorus:
What will you do with Jesus Christ?
As He pleads with you today;
Will you let Him in your heart
Or will you walk away.

2. Jesus Christ is still the same
He'll do the same for you,
The peace He gives is hard to understand;
He'll be the kindest truest friend
That you have ever had,
Don't crucify the Lord again
Don't turn your back on Him.

3. The Lord who died upon the cross
Will come to earth one day,
He's coming even now He's at the door
Will your soul be ready
And your sins be washed away?
Or will He turn His back on you
And say, 'I know you not'.

Chorus:
What will you do with Jesus Christ?
As He pleads with you today;
Will you let Him in your heart?
Or will you walk away?
Don't walk away.
