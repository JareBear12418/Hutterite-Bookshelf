1. Out on the hills of gloryland
So happy and free at God's right hand,
They tell of a place through marvelous grace
Called Heaven's Bright Shore.
Pilgrims of earth someday will go
To live in that home forever more,
I'm trusting in Him who died for sin
And rose from the grave.

Chorus:
On Heaven's Bright Shore there'll be no dying over there, (over there)
Not one little grave in all that fair land, (that wonderful land)
Not even a tear will dim the eye,
And no one up there will say goodbye,
Just singing His praise thru endless days
On Heaven's Bright Shore.

2. When I must cross that rolling tide
Someone will be on the other side;
To welcome my soul to that fair land,
Made perfect by love.
As I walk up that Milky Way,
I'll see the homecoming in array;
How great it must be for angels to see
A pilgrim reach home.
