If you see a man in sandals send him down my way
cause he might be my savior he's coming back some day
if you see a man in white like no one you've seen before
send him on to me cause that's the man I'm looking for

and if you can remember ask him whats his name
and if he tells you Jesus, say were so glad you came
but tell him you know someone that still calls him Lord
then send him on to me cause that's the man I'm looking for

If you see a man that shines with the love glow on his face
now turn him down my street so he can find my place
and if his hands are scarred no please don't shut the door
just send him on to me cause that's the man I'm looking for

and if you can remember ask him whats his name
and if he tells you Jesus, say were so glad you came
but tell him you know someone that still calls him Lord
then send him on to me cause that's the man I'm looking for

If you see a man called Jesus that's the man I'm looking for.
