1. My sheep know My voice, And the path that I take,
They follow wherever I go;
My sheep know My voice, And come at My call,
But a stranger's voice, do they not know.

Chorus:
My sheep know My voice,
(My sheep know My voice, day by day)
And day by day,
(My sheep know My voice, day by day)
They abide in the fold
(They abide in the fold, They go not astray)
And go not astray,
(Abide in the fold, They go not astray)
They love Me because
(They love Me because I made them My choice)
I have made them My choice,
(They love Me because I made them My choice)
And they fol - low My call,
(They follow My call, They follow My call)
For My sheep know My voice,
(My sheep know My voice)

2. My sheep know My voice, And the pastures of green,
Where I lead them so often to feed;
My sheep know My voice, And the cool sparkling stream
Where beside its still waters I lead.

3. My sheep know My voice, And the valley of death
Thro' which I shall lead them some day;
But no danger nor harm Can touch one of them,
For I will be with them always.
