1. Have you wandered away from your Father's care?
Heavy hearted and sad do you roam.
There's a sweet, gentle voice calling now to you,
'Wandering child, wandering child, oh come home.'

Chorus: Child, come home Child, come home;
(Child, come homeChild, come home)
Wandering child why longer roam?
(Wandering child, why longer roam?)
'Tis thy Father entreats,
('Tis thy Father now entreats)
Wandering child come home.
(Wandering child, wandering child, oh come home)
come home.

2. Is your frail bark adrift on life's raging sea?
Are you tossed on its billows and foam?
There's a safe harbor home waiting now for you;
Wandering child, wandering child, oh come home.

3. He is pleading today, heed His gentle voice,
As He bids you no longer to roam;
To that dear Father's house haste without delay,
Wandering child, wandering child, oh come home.
