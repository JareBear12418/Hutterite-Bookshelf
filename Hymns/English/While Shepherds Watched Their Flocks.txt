1. While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around.
'Fear not,' said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind,
'Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.'

2. 'To you, in David's town this day,
Is born of David's line,
The Savior, who is Christ the Lord,
And this shall be the sign:
The heav'nly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
And in a manger laid.'

3. Thus spake the seraph, and forth-with
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels praising God, and thus
Addressed their joyful song:
'All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace:
Good-will hence forth, from heav'n to men,
Begin and never cease.'
