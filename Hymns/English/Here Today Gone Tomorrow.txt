1. I keep watching for the dawning of tomorrow
Where we'll meet our blessed Savior in the sky
All the trouble of today will then be over
For God will wipe all the teardrops from our eyes.

Chorus:
We're here to day we'll be gone tomorrow
And this life won't even be a memory
We're here today we'll be gone tomorrow
Where we'll praise the Lord throughout eternity.

2. Today we're getting ready for that final journey
And I'm making plans to live in my new home
Soon those eastern skies will bloom with clouds of glory
At the sounding of the trumpet we'll be gone.
