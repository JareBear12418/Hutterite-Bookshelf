1. I care not today what the morrow may bring,
If shadow or sunshine or rain,
The Lord, I know, ruleth o'er everything,
And all of my worry is vain.

Chorus:
Living by faith, in Jesus above,
(Yes, living by faith, in Jesus above,)
Trusting, con - fid - ing in His great love;
(Trusting, confiding yes, in His great lot
From all harm safe in His sheltering arm,
(Safe from all harm, safe His sheltering arm,)
I'm living by faith and feel no alarm.
(I'm living by faith feel no alarm.)

2. Tho' tempests may blow and the storm clouds arise,
Obscuring the brightness of life,
I'm never alarmed at the overcast skies,
The Master looks on at the strife.

3. I know that He safely will carry me thro',
No matter what evils betide;
Why should I then care, tho' the tempest may blow,
If Jesus walks close to my side.

4. Our Lord will return to this earth some sweet day,
Our troubles will then all be o'er,
The Master so gently will lead us away,
Beyond that blest heav'nly shore
