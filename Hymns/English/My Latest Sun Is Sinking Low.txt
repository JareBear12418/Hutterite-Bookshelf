1. My latest sun is sinking fast,
My race is nearly run:
My strongest trial's now are past,
My triumph is begun.

Chorus:
O come, angel band,
Come, and around me stand;
O bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home; my immortal home.

2. I know I'm near the holy ranks
Of friends and kindred dear;
I brush the dews on Jordan's banks:
The crossing must be near.

3. I've almost gained my heavenly home,
My spirit loudly sings;
Thy holy ones, behold, they come!
I hear the noise of wings.
