1. There's a mighty army marching thru the land,
See the banners wave in ev'ry hand,
Soon the hosts of darkness shall be put to flight,
And a righteous reign pursue;
Hear the call that's ringing o'er this broad domain,
Who will help the victory to gain?
Hasten now, enlist you on the winning side,
There is glory there for you. (for you)

Chorus:
There is glory (glory) on the winning side,
(Yes) On the winning side, (yes) on the winning side,
There is (glory) glory on the winning side,
When the fight with sin is through (it's through).
There is (glory) glory on the winning side,
(Yes) on the winning side, (yes) on the winning side;
There is (glory) glory on the winning side,
On the winning side for you (for you).

2. After while victorious we shall surely stand,
With the good and true of ev'ry land,
We shall sing 'deliv'rance,' on a golden shore,
Evermore sweet peace pursue;
While the endless years roll on forever on,
We shall dwell 'mid scenes of love and song,
Hasten now, enlist you on the winning side.
There is glory there for you. (for you)
