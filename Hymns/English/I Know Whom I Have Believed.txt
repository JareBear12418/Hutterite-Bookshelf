1. I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me he hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for his own.

Chorus:
But 'I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that he is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto him against that day:'

2. I know not how this saving faith
To me he did impart,
Nor how believing in his Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

3. I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in him.

4. I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with him,
Or 'meet him in the air.'
