Chorus:
It's a stream of living water,
A bountiful supply;
A well is so deep it'll never run dry,
So if you are thirsty from a long dry spell,
Come get a drink from the well.
Come get a drink from the well.

1. You know you've been living in a dry and barren land,
Trying to make it by the works of your hands.
But it's not been raining there for quite some spell;
Why don't you come to the well?

2. You may hear the thunder and you may see the storm,
And there is no rain in your well in the morning.
A stream of living water flows from Calvary's hill;
Why don't you come to the well?
