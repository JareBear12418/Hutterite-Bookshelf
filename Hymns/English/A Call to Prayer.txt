1. Softly the evening vespers
Hallow the closing day;
Sweetly the Savior whispers,
'Come to the throne and pray.'

Refrain:
Softly I hear Him calling,
Calling at close of day;
Sweetly His tones are falling,
'Come to the throne and pray.'

2. Come, ere the shadows lengthen,
Bring Him thy burdened heart;
Come where His grace may strengthen,
Come from thy cares apart.

3. Smiles of His love await thee,
Lighting His lovely face;
Just to behold His beauty,
Dwell in the secret place.

4. Boldly we may approach Him,
Mercy and grace to own;
Tempted like us, He bid us
Come to the Father's throne.
