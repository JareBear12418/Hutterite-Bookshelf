1. I was living in a land of bondage
And I never saw the light of day
Thought I'd never be free again
God sent His only son to deliver me
And to show me a better way
I passed over into Canaan land.

Chorus: He brought me out of a barren wilderness
To a place that He chose for me
I've come too far to ever turn around again
And He's walking all the way beside me
And my soul found victory
I passed over into Canaan land

2. Milk and honey flowing in the land of promise
There are grapes hanging on the vine
I am camped with a happy band
Never gone along for the leeks and the garlics
I've left Egypt far behind
I passed over into Canaan land
