1. There's a rainbow of love that is pointing above,
Waving its banner high;
Let us follow the way it is leading today,
There's a rainbow of love in the sky. (That is shining in the sky).

Chorus:
There's a rainbow of love (that is pointing above,)
Look ye weary and lone and sad;
O this glory is sweet (Bringing rapture complete)
Precious rainbow of promise that is making us glad.

2. Tho' the pathway is rough and you meet with rebuff,
Many may pass you by;
But remember my friend, when the journey shall end,
There's a rainbow of love in the sky. (That is shining in the sky).

3. When our reaping is done, comes the setting of sun,
Never again to sigh,
We shall sweep thru the gate of that happy estate,
There's a rainbow of love in the sky. (That is shining in the sky).
