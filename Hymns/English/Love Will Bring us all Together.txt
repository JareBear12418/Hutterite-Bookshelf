1. All things work together for good,
When God's love is understood;
God is good and ev'rything He does is right.
Springtime flowers wilt and fade
but the mem'ries that they made
Are a ray of sunshine in the darkest night.

Chorus:
There's a Love that's calling from the other side,
(Love is calling from the other side)
As we stand and gaze across the great divide;
(As we stand and gaze across the great divide;)
God our father loves us all, Hear His tender loving call;
God, loves us all, O hear his tender call,)
Love will bring us all together by and by.

2. Light comes shining out of the past,
Truth revealing love at last;
There's a love that leads beyond the great divide.
Joy and laughter, pain and tears,
Love is calling thru the years;
Love will bring us safely to the other side.

3. Long ago when life was young,
Love already had begun;
Mem'ries of a time when roses were in bloom.
Time so swiftly past us flies,
Autumn comes and summer dies;
Love will bring us all together very soon.

4. Hear the music in the air,
God is love and ev'rywhere;
Walk in love and you will join God's happy throng.
Earthly things will lose their tune,
For they fade away so soon;
Love will bring us all together with a song.
