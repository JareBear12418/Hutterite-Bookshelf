1. We're in a mighty conflict here,
The army of the Lord
We must join forces sanding tall
And lean upon His word.
The enemy is now in view
And bravely circles round
Then comes the cry from the battlefield
Another soldier down.
Chorus
Go then with haste, stand by his side
And lend your strength once more
Oh build him up with faith and prayer
Until the battle's over.
The fight before the victory
The cross before the crown
Be ever watchful ere the cry
Another solider down.

2. We've set our minds on victory
Advancing day by day
With God our hope our strategy
Our fortress on the way
And at the end, there is a rest
An everlasting crown
All end the fear, no more we'll hear
Another soldier down.
