1. O Father, grant Thy grace and mercy
Unto this newly wedded pair.
O guide and keep them in Thy pathway,
That bounteous blessings they may share.
Be near them now, O Lord, we pray;
Thy presence bless them ev'ry day!

2. O may their life, with joy o'erflowing,
Be anchored in Thy boundless love.
In happy hours, in times of sorrow,
Lift Thou their hearts to heights above,
That by Thy hand they may be led,
Their souls with heav'nly manna fed.

3. O Father, hear our supplication,
For in Thy precious Name we pray.
Acknowledge our sincere petition
With countless blessings day by day.
For all Thy goodness, love and grace,
Accept our humble, heartfelt praise!
