1. Some folks may ask me some folks may say
Who is this Jesus you talk about every day
He is my Savior He set me free
Now listen what I tell you what He means to me.

Chorus: He is my everything He is my all
He is my everything both great and small
He gave Himself for me made everything new
He is my everything now how about you.

2. How oft I'm tempted but praise the Lord
In the name of Jesus through His Holy Word
I more than conquer I've Jesus within
I'm living in victory over Satan and sin.

3. He fills my soul with joy along life's way
He fills me through and through each night and day
Anoints my head with oil my cup overflows
Before I come there my Jesus He knows.
