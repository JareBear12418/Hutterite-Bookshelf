1. I was lost out in sin when Jesus found me,
Then he came and put his loving arms around me;
I surrendered my all into his keeping;
Praise the Lord! he redeemed my poor soul.

Chorus:
Yes, the love that brought Jesus down from heaven
Still is pleading to sinners, 'Will you come?' (Will you come?)
Won't you give him your heart and fully trust him?
He will lead you and guide you safely home.

2. Here's my life, Lord, I pray make me a blessing
Help me trust in thy grace my sin confessing;
Lest I wander away, Lord, keep me humble;
I will love thee and serve thee always.

3. When I come to the end of this journey,
Let me rest in thine arms; hold me securely.
Let me look on the face of him who loves me;
Dear soul, he wants your love too.
