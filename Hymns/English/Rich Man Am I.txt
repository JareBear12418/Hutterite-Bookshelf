1. I found something that money can't buy
I found a gold mine beyond the blue sky;
I found a land where I'll live when I die
I found the Lord, a rich man am I.

Chorus:
People may say that I'm dreaming a bit
But I like what I believe in
And I'm not gonna quit;
Well the book told me that I'll live when I die
I found the Lord, a rich man am I.

2. I found a love that's too sweet to tell
I found a faith that's no wishing well;
I found a life that I'll live till I die
I found the Lord, a rich man am I.

3. I found a dream that's sure to come true
I found a rainbow that's never turned blue;
I found a land where the teardrops are dry
I found the Lord, a rich man am I.

4. I found a song the angels can sing
I found a way to be rich as a king;
I found a love that'll burn till I die
I found the Lord, a rich man am I.
