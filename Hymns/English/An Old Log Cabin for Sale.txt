1. While strolling a long in the country
Reviewing the scenes new and old
I found an old fashioned log cabin
So beautiful there to be hold;
A stranger was standing in silence
His eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him
For these were the words that it bore.

Chorus:
And the sign read 'An old cabin For Sale'
An old oaken bucket and well,
'Easy Terms,' just keep a log on the fire
And a light burning bright in the dell,
Many years an old couple did patiently look
For their boy whose last promise did fail
Now the old rockin' chair will be rocking no more
There's an old log cabin for sale.

2. A welcome I read on the floor mat
An old braided rug by the door
The hands of an angel had made it
With many a prayer prayed before;
In an old rockin' chair, long she waited
For one glimpse of him how she yearned
And now he was standing in silence
Too late, yes, too late he'd returned.

3. How long has it been since you've written?
A letter to mother and dad
How long has it been since you've seen them?
Why don't you make their hearts glad?
Too soon will the old home be vacant
A candlelight gleaming no more
Don't wait till too late to remember
There may be a sign at the door.

There's no place like home.
