1. My buddies tell me, that I should have waited,
They say I'm missing a whole lot of fun;
But I am happy and I sing with pride,
I like the Christian Life.

Chorus:
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call,
For who is a friend who'd want you to fall?
Others find pleasure in things I despise,
I like the Christian Life.

2. My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus,
But I still love them, they burden my heart,
I'll try to lead them, to walk in the light,
I like the Christian Life.
