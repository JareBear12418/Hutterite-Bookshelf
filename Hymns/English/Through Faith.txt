1. This grace of God appeared
In Jesus Christ, His Son,
When lifted on the cross of shame,
The grace of God did flow;
Now all who do believe,
Because thro' Christ revealed
By grace they shall salvation find,
And Sons of God are we.

Chorus:
By grace are ye saved thro' faith,
Thro' faith, thro' faith, thro' faith, thro' faith;
Thro faith and that not of yourselves
Thro faith and that not of yourselves, not of works
Not of works lest any man should boast,
It is the gift of God;
Not of works lest any man should boast,
It is the gift of God.

2. Any every one of us
Is given of this grace;
According to the blessed measure
Of the gift of Christ;
Sufficient is this grace
For every need that is,
And so it is on us bestowed
If we would but believe.
