Who is worthy to be praised. (Who is worthy to be praised)
So shall I be saved from my enemies. (So shall I be saved from my enemies)

The Lord liveth, and blessed be the rock
And let the God of my salvation be exalted.

And let the God of my salvation be exalted.

And he rose up from the grave; (And he rose up from the grave)
I will live with him for eternity. (I will live with him for eternity)
