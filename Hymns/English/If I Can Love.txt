If I can smile when my heart is crying
If I can sing though the melody is o'er
If I can keep just one tear from failing
Then Jesus comes and He fills my heart with joy.

CHORUS

If I can love when the world stops loving
If I believe when the world believes no more
If I forgive when my friends forsake me
Then Jesus comes and He fills my heart with joy.

If I will trust when the world is doubting
If I will pray though others pray no more
And if I hope though my dreams be shattered
My Jesus holds to my hand forever more.

If through the storm I can see a rainbow
And through the rain I can see the shining sun
If I know peace while the world knows turmoil
'Tis all because I've a friend, God's only Son'
