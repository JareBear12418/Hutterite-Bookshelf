1. Here the Labor is so hard and the workers are so tired.
And our weary hearts are yearning for a rest;
And we find we're getting anxious to be in that happy land,
Where we receive such peace and happiness.

Chorus:
Wait a little longer, please Jesus,
There are so many wandering out in sin;
Just a little longer, please Jesus,
A few more days to get our loved ones in.

2. We may look into the skies and tears will fill our eyes,
When our burdened heart grows heavier with each day;
That we cry, O Lord, please come, come and take our children home,
Then we look around and suddenly we say.

3. The family scattered here and there, but Lord, we love them dear,
And maybe we can help them find their way;
Then if waiting is the cause, that they may not be lost,
Lord, that's the only reason why we say.
