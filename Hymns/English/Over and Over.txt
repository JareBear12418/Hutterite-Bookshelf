1. Over and over the Savior stands knocking,
Over and over He seeks to come in;
He will bring peace, passing all understanding
He will give power and victory o'er sin.

Chorus:
Jesus is seeking, the Spirit is pleading
Over and over, the story is told;
There is a welcome for Him that returneth
There is a place in the Good Shepherd's fold.

2. Over and over the Spirit has pleaded,
Over and over His voice has been heard;
Jesus is willing, is waiting to welcome
Souls that repent and believe in His word.

3. Over and over the penitent seeker,
Turning away from the sins of the world,
Turning to Christ, has found peace and salvation,
Under the banner of love He unfurled.

4. Over and over while Jesus is calling
Many go onward, unheeding His word;
Soon the dark shadows of death will be falling,
Soon the sad cry of 'too late' will be heard.
