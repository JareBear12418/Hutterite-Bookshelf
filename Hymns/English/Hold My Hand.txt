Chorus:
Hold my hand lest I lose my way
Hold my hand and lead me home
Guide each step that I might take
Hold my hand and keep me strong.
1
Let the paths I walk be straight
Let the deeds I do be kind
Let me never hesitate
To help my neighbor walking blind.
2
Let my words have meaning Lord.
Anything that I might speak
If you see me leaning Lord
Just hold my hand and strengthen me.
