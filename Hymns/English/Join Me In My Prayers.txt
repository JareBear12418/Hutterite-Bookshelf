1. I am walking with my Lord each day,
Warning everyone I see;
If they're heading down the wrong highway,
I ask them to walk with me.

Chorus:
Join me in my prayer
(Join me in my journey, Join me in my prayers)
If you're worried Jesus cares;
(If you 're sad and worried, Jesus sure will care;)
If you serve Him, in your life,
(If you serve Him, serve Him in your life,)
Brother! you'll be rewarded over there.

2. Those who travel down the road of sin,
Wear a lock upon their heart;
Seeking honor and the praise of men
God to them will say, 'Depart'.

3. I was drifting on the broad highway,
Many journeyed there with me;
At the closing I was made to pray
Now I'm singing victory.
