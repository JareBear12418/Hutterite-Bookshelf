1. This is the day, this is the day
That the Lord hath made, that the Lord hath made,
Let us rejoice, let us rejoice,
And be glad in it, and be glad in it;
This is the day that the Lord hath made,
Let us rejoice and be glad in it;
This is the day, this is the day
That the Lord hath made.

2. These are my friends, these are my friends
That the Lord hath given, that the Lord hath given.
Let us rejoice, Let us rejoice,
And be glad with them, and be glad with them;
These are my friends that the Lord hath given,
Let us rejoice and be glad with them;
These are my friends, these are my friends
That the Lord hath given.

3. We are the sons, we are the sons,
Of the living God, of the living God;
Let us rejoice, let us rejoice,
And be glad in Him, and be glad in Him;
We are the sons of the living God,
Let us rejoice and be glad in Him;
We are the sons, we are the sons,
Of the living God.
