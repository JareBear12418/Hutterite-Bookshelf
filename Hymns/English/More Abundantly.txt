1. Are you trusting Jesus, all along the way?
Does He grow more precious to your heart each day?
Are you His disciple; test His Word and see?
He will give the Spirit more abundantly.

Chorus:
More abundantly, more abundantly,
(More and more abundantly, more and more abundantly,)
'That they might have life and more abundantly,'
More abundantly, more abundantly,
(More and more abundantly, more and more abundantly,)
That they might have life, and more abundantly.

2. For His matchless favor magnify the name
Of our gracious Savior who from glory came;
Let the saints adore Him for this wondrous word,
Sealing our redemption thru the crimson flood.

3. Come to Him believing, harken to His call;
All from Him receiving, yield to Him your all;
Jesus will accept you when to Him you flee;
He will grant His blessings more abundantly.
