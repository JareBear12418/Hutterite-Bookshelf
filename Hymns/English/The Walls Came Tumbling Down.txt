1. The Lord told Joshua to go to Jericho,
And to march seven times around;
He followed faithfully the blessed Lord's command
And the walls came tumbling down.

Chorus:
Yes, the walls came tumbling down,
(Yes, the walls, and the walls, all the walls came tumbling down)
Joshua (Joshua) marched seven times around;
And the walls, and the walls, yes, the walls
(All the walls came tumbling down,)
All the walls came tumbling down.

2. If you are marching in the battle of the Lord,
Trusting only in His word;
You're sure to have victory with Jesus on your side,
Walls of fear will tumble down.

3. If you are trusting in the power of the blood,
And you hope to wear a crown;
Go forward quickly and obey God's holy word,
Walls of doubt will tumble down.
