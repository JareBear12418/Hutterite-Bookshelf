1. There is a reason God made the dazzling sun,
Made all the stars and counted them one by one.
There is a reason He made the rain-tossed night,
Thunder and darkness followed by morning light.

Chorus: There is a reason though we can't understand.
(There is a reason
There is reason one that the Lord has planned.
(There is a reason)
There is reason someday He'll make it plain,
(There is a reason)
The reason why there is heartache, and grief, and pain.

2. There is a reason God asks the seed to die,
Once 'twas a flower, radiant as summer skies?
There is a reason why the sweet blossoms fade:
Harvest is coming, why should we be afraid.

3. There is a reason those whom He loves are tried;
Called on to suffer, with Him the crucified.
There is a reason everything works for good,
For those who trust Him, for He had said it would.
