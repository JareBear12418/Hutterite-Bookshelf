1. I gave my life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might'st, ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead;
I gave, I gave my life for thee,
What hast thou giv'n for me?
I gave, I gave my life for thee,
What hast thou giv'n for me?

2. My Father's house of light,
My glory-circled throne
I left, for earthly night,
For wand'rings sad and lone;
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for me?
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for me?

3. I suffered much for thee,
More than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitt'rest agony,
To rescue thee from hell;
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for me?
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for me?

4. And I have brought to thee,
Down from my home above,
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and my love;
I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee,
What hast thou brought to me?
I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee,
What hast thou brought to me?
