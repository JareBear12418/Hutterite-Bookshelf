1. Over yonder awaits a glad tomorrow,
It will dawn when our Savior comes to reign,
Then redeemed ones from every tribe and nation,
Will be free from all sorrow, grief and pain.

Chorus:
And the city hath no need of a light when day is done,
For the Glory of the Lamb shineth brighter than the sun
In His presence we shall be, He shall wipe all tears away,
And we'll dwell with our blessed Lord and Savior,
In the Glory of an eternal day.

2. John the Prophet, was on the isle of Patmos,
When a voice came from heaven strong and clear,
'Come up hither, I'll show thee the here-after,
That all people this blessed truth may hear.'

3. 'Thou art worthy, O Lord, of all the glory,'
Sang the elders to Christ who had been slain,
'For Thy blood hath redeemed men of all nations,
Kings hath made us, and with Thee we shall reign.'
