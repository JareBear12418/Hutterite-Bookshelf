(Psalm 25)
1. Unto thee, O Lord, (Unto thee, O Lord)
Do I lift up my soul. (Do I lift up my soul)

Chorus:
O my God, (O my God)
I trust in thee, (I trust in thee)
Let me not be ashamed,
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

2. Yea, let none that wait (Yea, let none that wait)
On thee be ashamed. (On thee be ashamed)

3. Show me thy ways, (Show me thy ways)
Thy ways, O Lord. (Thy ways, O Lord)

4. Remember not (Remember not)
The sins of my youth. (The sins of my youth)

5. All the paths of the Lord (All the paths of the Lord)
Are mercy and truth. (Are mercy and truth)
