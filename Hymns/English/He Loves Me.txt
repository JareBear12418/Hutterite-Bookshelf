1. Boundless eternal the love that He gave,
Reaching from heaven to hell and the grave,
My soul from darkness forever to save,
What love, what wonderful love.
He loves me, let no one deny it,
And His whole life forever shall be,
Go shout it from every tall mountain,
That the great Lord of all loves me.

2. Such pain and anguish He bore on the cross,
Shedding His life's light to save me from loss;
Dying for sinners at such humble cost,
What love, what wonderful love.
He loves me, let no one deny it,
And His love through the ages is true;
Accept Him, let Christ be your Savior,
For the great Lord of all loves you.

3. Black were the sin stains that darkened my soul,
Heavy my burden and lonely my road;
Mercy delivered and now I am whole
What love, what wonderful love.
He loves me, let no one deny it,
And His whole life forever shall be
Go shout it from every tall mountain,
That the great Lord of all loves me.
