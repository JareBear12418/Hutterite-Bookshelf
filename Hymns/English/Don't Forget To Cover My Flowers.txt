It's been many years now since Mom passed away.
There are many sweet memories that I have today.
When I see autumn and leaves turning brown,
I feel like Mama is somewhere around.

CH:Don't forget to cover my flowers,
I can still hear my sweet mother say.
Be sure to cover my flowers.
Or my flowers will whither away.

Yes, I remember, though it's been so long.
My heart feels heavy and life seems so wrong.
I'd give all my treasures and things I might own
To go back to Mama's old country home.

As I wait in this jungle, in this foreign land
Of people so indifferent to God and His men.
It's kill or be killed and I wonder today
If the ones that I'm fighting think of Mama this way.
