1. I am redeemed by the blood of the Lamb,
I am redeemed by the blood of the Lamb,
I am redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Saved from sins I know I am,
All my sins are taken away, (taken away.)

2. If you go there before I do,
If you go there before I do,
If you go there before I do;
Just look me up I'll be there, too,
All my sins are taken away, (taken away.)

3. You can talk about me just all you please,
You can talk about me just all you please,
You can talk about me just all you please;
I'll pray for you down on my knees,
All my sins are taken away, (taken away)

4. I'm going down to the garden to pray,
I'm going down to the garden to pray,
I'm going down to the garden to pray;
I was so blessed I stayed all day,
All my sins are taken away, (taken away.)

5. I'm going home on the morning train,
I'm going home on the morning train,
I'm going home on the morning train;
Glory, glory I can sing,
All my sins are taken away, (taken away.)
