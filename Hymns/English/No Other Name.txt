1. Jesus how sweet is your name to my ear;
Since I've found Him I've not been the same;
Truly His love drives away every fear,
And oh, there is power in His name.

Chorus: No other name, no other name,
Only Jesus salvation can give;
And only through Him, can we enter the fold,
Changed and made worthy to live.

2. Jesus, the giver of everything good,
He knoweth the need of a man;
He healeth my soul, for He said that He would,
And oh, there is power in His name.

3. Jesus has said that a mortal as I,
All of heaven's bright treasures may gain;
I'm an heir to the kingdom through His royal blood,
And oh, there is power in His name.
