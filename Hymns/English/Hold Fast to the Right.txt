1. Kneel down by the side of your mother my boy
You have only a moment I know
But stay 'til I give you this parting advice
It is all that I have to bestow.

Chorus: Hold fast to the right, hold fast to the right
Wherever your footsteps may roam
Oh forsake not the way of salvation my boy
That you learned from your mother at home.

2. I gave you to God in your cradle my boy
And I've taught you the best that I knew
And as long as His mercy permits me to live
I shall never cease praying for you.

3. You will leave us to seek your employment my boy
By the world you have yet to be tried
But in the temptations and trials my boy
May your heart in the Savior confide.

4. You will find in your satchel a Bible my boy
It's the book of all others the best
It will help you to live and prepare you to die
And will lead you to the gates of the blest.
