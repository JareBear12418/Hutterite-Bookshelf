1. Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
O what words I hear Him say!
Happy words! so near, so precious!
May it find me there each day.
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
I would look upon the past;
For His love has been so gracious,
It has won my heart at last.

2. Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Where can mortal find more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And, when weary, find sweet rest.
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
There I love to weep and pray,
While I from His fullness gather
Grace and comfort ev'ry day.

3. Bless me, O my Savior, bless me,
As I sit low at Thy feet,
Oh, look down in love upon me,
Let me see Thy face so sweet.
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
Make me holy as He is;
May I prove I've been with Jesus,
Who is all my righteousness.
