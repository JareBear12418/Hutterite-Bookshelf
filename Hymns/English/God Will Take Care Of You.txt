1. God will take care of you, be not afraid,
He is your safe guard, through sunshine and shade;
Tenderly watching and keeping His own,
He will not leave you to wander alone.

Chorus:
God will take care of you till to the end,
O what a Father, Redeemer and Friend;
Jesus will answer whenever you call
He will take care of you, trust Him for all.

2. God will take care of you, through all the day,
Shielding your footsteps, directing your way;
He is your Shepherd, Protector and Guide
Leading His children where still waters glide.

3. God will take care of you long as you live,
Granting you blessings no other can give;
He will take care of you when time is past,
Safe to His Kingdom, will bring you at last.
