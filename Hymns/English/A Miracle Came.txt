1. My friends all have religion
They show to me the way,
I asked them all about it
They say you have to pray;
Dear Lord, I am a sinner
So hear me on my knees,
I know you have Salvation,
Lord For you have promised me.

Chorus:
Then like '¦ the sound of thunder,
Sweet like '¦ the summer rain;
Swift like '¦ a bolt of lighting,
Thanks God a miracle came.

2. Knock and the door shall open
Seek and ye shall find,
All these promises came true
The day I made Him mine;
Now darkness grows much lighter
I saw the miracle sun,
The miracles made me suffer
Salvation plan was done.
