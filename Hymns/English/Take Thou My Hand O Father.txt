1. Take Thou my hand, O Father,
And lead Thou me,
Until my journey endeth,
Eternally!
Alone I will not wander
One single day;
Be Thou my true Companion
And with me stay.

2. Oh, cover with Thy mercy
My poor, weak heart!
Let ev'ry thought rebellious
From me depart.
Permit Thy child to linger
Here at Thy feet,
And blindly trust Thy goodness
With faith complete.

3. Though naught of Thy great power
May move my soul,
With Thee through night and darkness
I reach the goal.
Take, then, my hand, O Father,
And lead Thou me,
Until my journey endeth,
Eternally!
