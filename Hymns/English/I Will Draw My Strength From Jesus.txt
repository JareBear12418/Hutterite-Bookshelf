1. I will draw my strength from Jesus,
As I lay upon His breast.
I will take my comfort from Him,
I will find in Him sweet rest.

Chorus: For there is no other fountain,
Where I can be more satisfied,
Than in the arms of Christ my Savior;
No blessings I will be denied.
2
All pain will leave my aching body.
As His sweet healing nurture flows.
Demons tremble in His presence,
In Jesus' name they have to go.

3. Some morning in that yonder city,
I will awake and sleep no more.
In God's presence live forever,
All pain and sin will all be o'er.
