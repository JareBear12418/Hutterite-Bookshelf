1. A mother went out to a party
And left at home her baby boy,
He cried and begged her not to leave him
But she could not give up her joy;
She kissed his cheeks and tried to soothe him,
She heeded not his childish plead,
She heard him call as she was leaving,
'Please, mommy, please stay home with me.'

2. The mother joined the merry makers,
And soon was left in trifling joy,
The mellow joys and flickering shadows,
Made her forget her baby boy;
She danced and laughed, and did some drinking,
To her this world was full of glee,
But now and then those words would haunt her,
'Please, mommy, please stay home with me.'

3. She left the party feeling dizzy,
The smell of drink was on the breath,
She hurried home to find her baby,
In raging pain and close to death;
The doctor came and looked on sadly,
The case was hopeless, he could see,
The baby died those words repeating,
'Please, mommy, please stay home with me.'

4. The mother now her life would forfeit,
To hear her baby's voice again,
She grieved the day, she rudely left him,
To satisfy her useless gain;
Now mothers don't neglect your duty,
This story let a lesson be,
Do not ignore your children's pleading,
'Please, mommy, please stay home with me.'
