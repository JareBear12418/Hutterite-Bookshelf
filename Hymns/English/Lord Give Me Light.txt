1. If I have not forsaken all,
In answer to thy loving call.
If I've kept something back from thee,
Lord, give me light that I might see.

2. Lord, help me judge myself each day,
To walk this new and living way.
I seek thy grace with all my heart,
To be made pure just as thou art.

3. If anything upon this earth,
Attracts me with its sense of worth,
If money has a hold on me,
Lord, give me light that I might see.

4. If all my life revolves 'round me,
And thoughts of my own family,
If I am living selfishly,
Lord, give me light that I might see.

5. Is there some good I should have done?
Is there some soul I should have won?
Have I hurt someone thoughtlessly?
Lord, give me light that I might see.

6. If someone's failure has not wrought,
Concern and care within my heart.
If I've judged others inwardly,
Lord, give me light that I might see.

7. If I have cared for men's applause,
Or sought my own and shunned the cross.
If I have feared men's mockery,
Lord, give me light that I might see.

8. If I've not sought thy power in prayer,
Because of earthly toils and care.
If I'm not longing after thee,
Lord, give me light that I might see.
