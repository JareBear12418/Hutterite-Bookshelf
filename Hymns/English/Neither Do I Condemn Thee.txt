1. By a crowd of worshippers, sorry for their sins,
Was a poor wanderer rudely brought in;
Scribes came and Pharisees anxious to see,
What a meek Nazarenes verdict would be.

Chorus:
Neither do I condemn thee, precious words divine,
From the lips of mercy, like the sweetest chime;
Wonderful words of Jesus sing them o'er and o'er,
Neither do I condemn thee, go and sin no more.

2. They told of her wanderings, making each flaw,
Spoke of her punishment, quoting the law;
Writing upon the ground, sadly and slow,
But said He unheedingly head bending low.

3. Still cried the Pharisees, pray, Master, pray,
What shall we do with her, what dos'th Thou say;
Then said He rebukingly, 'Let the first stone,
Come from the sinless hands, hence and alone.'

4. Cheeks flushing with the shame, turning about,
And from His presence walking slowly out;
Then saw me standing there, head bending low
He whom all the world despised, bade her sin no more.

5. Spoke He most tenderly, 'Pray, women, pray,
Hast thou no accusers,' 'nay, Master, nay'
Neither do I condemn thee, soul, sick and sore
Go forth I pardon thee, go and sin no more.
