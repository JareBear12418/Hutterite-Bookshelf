1. Oh, I thank you, Lord, for your faithfulness,
And I thank you, Lord, for your truth.
There's been times I just did not understand,
But I thank you, Lord, for your Word.

Chorus:
It's the Word that sets us free,
It is the Word that brings light
When there's darkness all around.
It's that spoken Word from the mouth of God,
And I thank you, Lord, for your Word.

2. We are waiting for fulfillment now,
For your promise to be real,
For without reality and truth,
Joy is withered from sons of men.

3. May a fire go before us now,
Consuming every wrinkle and spot,
That we might stand as a people now,
Being holiness to the Lord.
