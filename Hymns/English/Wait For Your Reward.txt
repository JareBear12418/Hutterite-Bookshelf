1. Wait for the Lord, all ye who are righteous,
Despise not the wicked, for they have their reward.
Wait for the Lord, all ye who are righteous,
Despise not the wicked, for they have their reward.

2. You shall ride on the heights of the earth,
And taste of things not seen, nor heard;
You shall declare the greatness of the Lord,
Wait always for your reward.
