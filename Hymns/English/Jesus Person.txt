1. If you can rise up in the morning,
Thinking only of what to give,
If you labor thro the day,
So that others might live;
If you rest in peace at night
Because you've learned to forgive,
Than you're a Jesus Person,
And its the only way to live.

2. If you can suffer in silence
Just to save another's pain,
If your courage does not fail
When you labor but all in vain;
If you're hurt by those you love,
Yet faithful to them remain,
Then you're a Jesus person,
And you shall not live in vain.

3. If you can sense all the sorrow
Hidden deep in tearless eyes,
If you know when to speak,
And know when silence is wise;
If you share another's joys
And with another's cry,
Then you're a Jesus person,
And you know the reason why.

4. If you can rise up in the morning
And rejoice in who you are,
If you go with one who needs you
And never ask how far;
If you give and always find
That you still have more to give,
Then you're a Jesus person,
And its the only way to live.
