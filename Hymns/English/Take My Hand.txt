1. Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be;
Then my heart felt alone and I cried, 'Oh, Lord!'
Don't hide your face from me.'

Chorus:
Take my hand all the way, every hour, every day,
From here to the great Unknown
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone.

2. Like a king I may live in a palace so tall,
With great riches to call my own;
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone.
