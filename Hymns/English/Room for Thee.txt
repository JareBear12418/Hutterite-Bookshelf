1. Thou didst leave Thy throne, and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home there was found no room
For Thy holy nativity.

Chorus:
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee.
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come!
There is room in my heart for Thee.

2. Heaven's arches rang, when the angels sang,
Of Thy birth, and Thy royal decree;
But in lowly birth didst Thou come to earth,
And in greatest humility.

3. Foxes found their rest, and the birds had their nests
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee.

4. Thou camest, O Lord, with the living Word
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking and scorn, and with crown of thorn
Did they take Thee to Calvary.

5. When the heavens shall ring and its choirs shall sing,
At Thy coming to victory,
Thou wilt call me home, saying, 'Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee.'
