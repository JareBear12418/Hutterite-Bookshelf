1. Beautiful robes so white, Beautiful land of light,
Beautiful home so bright, Where there shall come no night;
Beautiful crown I'll wear, Shining with stars o'er there,
Yonder in mansions fair, Gather us there.

Chorus:
Beautiful robes, (Beautiful robes of white,)
Beautiful land (Beautiful land of light,)
Beautiful home, (Beautiful home so bright,)
Beautiful band, (Beautiful band of might,)
Beautiful crown, (Beautiful, beautiful crown,)
Shining so fair, (Shining, yes, shining so fair,)
Beautiful mansion bright, (Beautiful mansion bright,)
Gather us there. (Gather us there, yes, gather us there.)

Beautiful thought to me, We shall forever be
Thine in eternity, When from this world we're free;
Free from its toil and care, Heavenly joys to share,
Let me cross over there; This is my prayer.

3. Beautiful things on high, Over in yonder sky,
Thus I shall leave this shore, Counting my treasure o'er;
Where we shall never die, Carry me by and by,
Never to sorrow more. Heavenly shore.
