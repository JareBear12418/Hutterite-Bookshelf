It's a land of beauty and its splendor
Can't be seen by human eyes.
Where the day shall be unending
And no clouds will gather in the skies.
Angels singing, glory hallelujah
To our God upon His throne!
Gladness will abound for those who've fought the fight
And left their earthly home.
In the land of beauty where the pilgrim
Shall receive a crown of love.

It's a land of beauty where the lonely
And the weary shall be free;
Free from all the trials and the sorrows
And the sickness they have seen.
God Himself will take them by the hand
And He will whisper, 'I love you.'¬ù
In the land of beauty where the pilgrim
Shall receive a crown of love.

It's a land of beauty where the saddest heart
Shall find eternal joy.
Singing in God's choir they shall join the angels
Sing of peace and love.
There all cares will be forgotten and they'll share in bliss
They've never known;
In the land of beauty where the pilgrim
Shall receive a crown of love.
