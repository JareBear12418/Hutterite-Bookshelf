1. Where Jesus' love is binding,
There's naught on earth may part
This true communion finding,
Where both are one in heart.
The blessings He bestoweth,
And love, shall never fail;
E'en when in joy or sorrow,
His mercy will prevail.

2. Grant that the bond between them
On earth may never cease,
The praises of Thy anthem
May ever more increase.
And may Thy Spirit's leading
Thus guide them on their way;
With love, in Thee abiding,
Lord, ever with them stay!
