1. There's a God who's standing at heaven's door,
He's looking this universe o'er;
And He see's each mortal with a searching eye,
You can't do wrong and get by.

Chorus:
You can't do wrong and get by,
No matter how much you may try;
Nothing hidden can be, ev'rything He doth see,
You can't do wrong and get by.

2. Out into the darkness you alone may go,
And seeds for the wicked one sow;
There's an eye that's watching from the throne on high,
You can't do wrong and get by.

3. Yes, He knows your secrets, ev'rything you do,
He knows that your life is untrue;
You can ne'er deceive Him, there's no use to try,
You can't do wrong and get by.
