1. Oh Lord I need you close to me
When you seem so far away
To put your arms around me
And love this hurt away
Oh I open up my heart
To let your light come shining through
Oh Lord I need this special touch
That comes from you- only you- only you.

2. Oh Lord you said you'd never leave
Me to face things all alone
That I can cast my cares on you
And my burdens you will bear
For when I look around
And see the misery and strife
That's when I turn my eyes unto
The hills for strength from Thee.

3. Oh Lord I thank you for your love
You are worthy to be praised
For when the winds blow all around
I can call upon your face
Even though my friends are close
You are still the only one
Who can calm the sea and set me free
And fill my life with peace.
