Chorus: Lord, I know you'd find me, 'cause that's the way you are,
Like a shepherd searching for the lamb that's wandered far.
I'm sure I'll never leave you, but realizing that I could,
It's comforting to know you'd love me;
I know you would, I know you would.

1. If I should somehow stray away from all that's pure and good,
And wake up somewhere I thought I never would.
When you heard me calling, without wondering if you should,
Would you long to hold me? I know you would.

2. If I should take back from you what I gave to you to hold,
And take it out and waste it, on fun or fame or gold.
When you saw it lying there, stained among the goods,
Would you buy it back with love? I know you would.
