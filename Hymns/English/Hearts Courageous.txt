1. Give us ears to hear that still small voice;
And give us lips forever willing to rejoice;
And may our eyes be lit with wisdom,
May we know the path that's true;
And we'll march with hearts courageous after you.

Chorus:
We're marching on with hearts courageous,
We'll follow anywhere you want us to;
And should you lead us where the battle rages,
Let us march with hearts courageous after you.

2. And when sorrow dims the light along the way,
Help us to see each time of darkness through eyes of faith;
A time for hope, a time for courage,
Knowing you will lead us through;
And we'll march with hearts courageous after you.
