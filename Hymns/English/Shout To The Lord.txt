1. My Jesus, my Savior; Lord, there is none like you.
All my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength;
Let every breath, all that I am,
Never cease to worship you.

Chorus:
Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing:
Power and majesty, praise to the King.
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of your name.
I sing for joy at the work of your hand,
Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand;
Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
