1. Someday when I go to my resting place,
Resting while sweet angels sing;
I'll be with my friends
In a sweet peaceful rest,
Waiting for the call of my king.

Chorus:
Resting in peace, waiting the call ... (Waiting the call,)
List'ning for Jesus to call my name ... (List'ning for Him)
Resting in peace, angels will sing 'Â¦ (Waiting the call,)
Waiting the call of my king.

2. Someday when the sun refuses to shine.
Stars from the heavens will fall;
I'll awake from my sleep
In a change of the great,
I'll rise when I hear Jesus call.
