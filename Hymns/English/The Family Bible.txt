1. There's a family Bible on the table,
Each page is torn and hard to read;
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memory.

Chorus:
I can see us sitting 'round the table,
When from the family Bible dad would read;
I can hear my mother softly singing
'Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me '

2. At the close of day when work was over,
And when the evening meal was done;
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one.

3. This old world of ours, it's for trouble
But this world, would, oh, so better be;
If we'd find more Bibles on the table
And mothers singing, 'Rock of Ages cleft for me.'
