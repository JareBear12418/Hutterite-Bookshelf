1. Oh fathom less mercy, Oh infinite grace,
With humble thanksgiving, the road we retrace;
Thou never hast failed us; our strength and our stay:
To whom should we turn for the rest of the way?

Chorus: To whom should we turn for the rest of the way?
To whom should we go for our strength for the day?
In thee have we trusted nor found thee to fail:
Lord, thee will we follow the rest of the way.

2. Thru danger, thru darkness, by day and by night,
Thou ever hast guided and guided aright;
In thee have we trusted, and prayerfully laid,
Our hand in thy hand for the rest of the way.

3. Thy cross is our refuge, thy blood all our plea,
None other we need now, Lord Jesus, but thee;
We fear not the shadows at close of the day,
For thou wilt go with us the rest of the way.
