1. Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
Blessed Redeemer, and Savior thou art,
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, thy presence my light.

2. Be thou my wisdom, be thou my true Word;
I ever with thee, and thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.

3. Be thou my buckler, my sword for the fight;
Be thou my dignity, thou my delight,
Thou my soul's shelter, thou my high tow'r;
Raise thou me heav'nward, O pow'r of my pow'r.

4. Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise;
Thou my inheritance, now and always:
Thou and thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure thou art.
5
High King of heaven, when vict'ry is won
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's sun!
Heart of my heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
