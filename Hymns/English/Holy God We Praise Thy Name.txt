1. Holy God, we praise thy name;
Lord of all, we bow before thee;
All on earth thy scepter claim,
All in heav'n above adore thee:
Infinite thy vast domain,
Everlasting is thy reign.

2. Hark, the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising;
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising;
Fill the heav'ns with sweet accord:
Holy, holy, holy Lord.

3. Lo! the apostolic train,
Joins thy sacred name to hallow;
Prophets swell the glad refrain,
And the white robed martyrs follow;
And, from morn to set of sun,
Through the Church the song goes on.

4. Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit: three we name thee,
While in essence only one:
Undivided God we claim thee,
And adoring, bend the knee,
While we sing our praise to thee.
