1. Mother always wanted me to read the Bible,
She wanted me to do some praying, too;
She pleaded with me, to accept my Savior,
But I had other worldly things to do.

Chorus:
I'm reading it now,
I'm reading it every day;
Tell her that I really understand it
Tell her that I finally found the way.

2. It hurts to know how much I worried mother,
She prayed that I would find the way somehow;
It took awhile but, Lord, You can assure her,
I found the book, and, Lord, I'm reading it now.
