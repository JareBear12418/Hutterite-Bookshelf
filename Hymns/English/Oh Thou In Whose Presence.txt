1. Oh thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,
On whom in affliction I call;
My comfort by day and my song in the night
My hope, my Salvation, my all.

2. Where dost Thou Dear Shepherd resort with Thy sheep?
To feed them in pastures of love;
Say why in the valley of death would I weep
Or alone in this wilderness rove.

3. Oh why should I wander an alien from Thee?
Or cry in the desert for bread?
Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrow they see
And smile at the tears I have shed.

4. Dear Shepherd I hear and will follow Thy call
I know the sweet sound of Thy voice;
Restore and defend me for Thou art my all
And in Thee I will ever rejoice.
