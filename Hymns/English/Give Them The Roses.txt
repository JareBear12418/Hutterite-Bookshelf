1. Wonderful things of folks are said,
When they have passed away;
Roses adorn their narrow bed
Over the sleeping clay.

Chorus:
Give them the roses while they live,
Trying to cheer them on,
Useless the flowers that we give
After the soul is gone.

2. Praises, are heard not by the dead,
Roses, they cannot see,
Let us not wait till souls have fled
Generous friends to be.

3. Faults are forgiven when folks lie,
Cold on their narrow bed,
Let us forgive them ere they die,
Now should the words be said.
