1. A little boy stood gazing into the clouds above;
'I know my kite is still up there,
For I can feel the tug:'
A smile then crossed his little face,
The tug had made it real;
That's just the way the Spirit works,
Thank God for what I feel.

Chorus:
Thank God for what I feel inside,
I know my God is real;
I can feel his tug from heaven above,
My hungry soul he feeds.
God gave his only Son to die,
A ransom, oh what love;
I know God holds the thread of life,
For I can feel the tug.

2. When life down here is finished,
And I cross the great divide;
I'll be free from all sorrow,
When I've reached the other side.
My treasures are up yonder,
In a land of perfect love;
I know God holds the thread of life,
For I can feel the tug.
