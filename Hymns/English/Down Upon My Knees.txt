1. Although its not a popular place,
I found a heavenly spot,
Down on my knees alone with God,
Where men can see me not;
I used to worry and complain,
I used to live in fear,
Until I found a secret place,
Where none but God can hear.

Chorus:
O yes, things look dif - frent
(Yes, things look different, yes, things look different,)
When I'm down upon my knees;
(Down upon my knees, down upon my knees,)
My Dear, fellow traveler,
(Dear fellow traveler, dear fellow traveler,)
Won't you try it won't you please.
(Try it, won't you please, won't you try it please.)

2. I've viewed majestic mountains
And some flower gardens fair;
I've watched the ocean waves roll in,
I've seen some buildings rare;
But North and South and East and West,
His wonders can't compare,
In all the earth none can't surpass,
My secret place in prayer.

3. I cannot tell of worldly fames,
Or purses filled with gold,
My home perhaps will be a cottage
Ever when I'm old;
Though some may scoff it matters not,
For I have wealth and ease,
My Jesus has a storehouse great,
And I have found the keys.

4. As friend to friend I tell my Jesus
All my joys and woe,
I listen as He speaks to me,
With tongue so sweet and low;
And when I rise to face the world,
My heart is set as ease,
The situation always changes
Down upon my knees.
