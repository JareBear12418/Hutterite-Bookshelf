1. There's a great judgment day, that is coming we know,
It's coming to one and all;
For the judge shall proclaim,
His power divine
And judge both, the great and the small.

Chorus:
When Jesus comes, and the judgment is said,
Oh, who will be at His right hand?
When the trumpets shall sound
And the nations have come,
Oh, who shall be able to stand?

2. Then the righteous and wicked together shall meet,
To judgment they shall shall be brought;
And the judge shall proclaim,
To the righteous 'well done',
To the wicked 'I know yea not.'

3. There will be great rejoicing of happy ones there,
Who followed the Savior here,
When they hear Him declare,
'Come here blessed of mine',
And enter my home so fair.

4. But there'll be lamentation and mourning that day,
When Jesus shall say 'depart',
And the wicked shall flea,
From His presence away,
With trembling of every heart.
