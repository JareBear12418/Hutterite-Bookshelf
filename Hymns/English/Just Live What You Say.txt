1. Don't say that you Love them, then live like you don't
You'll think they'll believe you, I tell you they won't
Don't think that this world, is made up of fools
They're watching your life, do you live by the rules.

2. Don't say that he's very, important to you
When everything else, dominates what you do
They'll never believe you, unless they can see
You're words and you're life together agree.

Chorus:
So Just live what you say,
Show them that Jesus is truly the way
Just live what you say,
Someone is watching your life today.

3. So be an example in all that you do,
Show them that Jesus is living in you
Speak of his power and love everyday,
Live like you mean it, and show them the way.
