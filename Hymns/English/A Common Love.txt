1. A common love for each other,
A common gift to the Savior,
A common bond holding us to the Lord;
A common strength when we're weary,
A common hope for tomorrow,
A common joy in the truth of God's Word.

Descant:
Love, little children, love one another:
This is because our God is love, he is love.
Keep his commandments, this is the vict'ry;
The truth that overcomes the world.
