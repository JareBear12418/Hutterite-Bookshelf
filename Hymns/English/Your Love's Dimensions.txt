1. Higher than the Heavens, and deeper than the sea
Was the love you showed us, when you died on Calvary
Broader then the whole world, as far as east and west
You came to show us true love, so you gave your very best

2. And I know your love's dimension
is beyond my comprehension
But this is my heart's intention, to serve you till I die
Oh I know I can't repay you,
with the things that I might say or do
But I still want to obey you, because your love is always, so true

3. Riches that are deeper, than we can ever know
Yet through your holy spirit, your will to us you showed
But though we keep on digging, in the depths of your ways
When it's all said and done then we still will have to say

4. That we know your love's dimension is beyond our comprehension
But this is our heart's intention, to serve you till we die
Oh we know we can't repay you,
with the things that we may say or do
But we still want to obey you, because your love is always so true.
