1. All my life I've lived to satisfy my needs,
So sure my friends and earthly treasures were all I'd need,
Never once concerned about my sins;
Never once prepared to let my Savior in.

Chorus:
Lord, I know these chains you will release,
Lord, I know your promise you will keep;
These shackles of sin will fall away,
When we fall upon our knees, Lord, and pray.

2. Lord, I know you're knocking at my door,
And, Lord, I know you're pleading more and more,
To open my heart and let you in;
To lead me onward from this life of sin.

3. Lord, your love has shown me right from wrong,
And your guiding hands have been so strong,
From those shackles of sin, Lord, I've been freed;
Lord, your love and guiding hand is all I need.

Chorus:
Lord, I know those chains you have released;
Lord, I know your promise you have kept;
Those shackles of sin, Lord, fell away,
When I fell upon my knees, Lord, and prayed.
