1. I know of a river whose beautiful stream
Flows gently and calm thro' the land;
Its waters are pure for the healing within,
'Tis flowing from Jesus our Friend.

Chorus:
Dear soul, we pray, will you come,
And wash in this wonderful stream?
This water flows free, so clear and true,
Believe, 'tis flowing for you.

2. To those that give heed it will blessings impart,
Its flowing will not be in vain,
For blessedness comes and peace in your heart,
Redeems you from sorrow and pain.

3. To them that are thirsty the Spirit and bride
Say, come! you may drink of it free!
All those that are washed and in Jesus abide,
Our Father in heaven receives.
