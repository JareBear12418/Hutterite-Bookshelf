If you're tired of the life that you're living
Than why don't you change it now?
For no one knows what tomorrow holds.
There's no greater time than now!

CH:There's no greater time than now!
There's no greater time than now!
Don't let this chance pass, for it could be your last.
There's no greater time than now!

So come while the choir is singing.
Oh, come while time still allows.
Oh, come and be saved before it is too late.
There's no greater time than now!
