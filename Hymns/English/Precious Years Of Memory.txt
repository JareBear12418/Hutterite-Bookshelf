There's a place dear to me where I'm longing to be
With my friends at the old country church.
Where with Mother we went and our Sundays we spent.
With my friends at the old country church.

CH:Precious years of memory,
Oh what joy they bring to me.
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the old country church.

As a small country boy how my heart filled with joy
As I knelt in the old country church.
With the Saviour above and His wonderful love
Filled my soul at the old country church.
