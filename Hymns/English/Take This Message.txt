CH:Take this message to my mother.
It will fill her heart with joy.
Tell her that I've met my Saviour.
God has saved her wandering boy.

The tears and sorrows I have caused her,
How I wish I could repay.
But tell her I'll be waiting for her.
We'll meet in Heaven some glad day.

How she cried when I left her.
I know it filled her heart with pain.
She said, son do not leave me,
For we may never meet again.

Years have passed since our parting,
But I know she waits and prays.
Soon we'll cross that dark river.
We'll let her know that I was saved.
