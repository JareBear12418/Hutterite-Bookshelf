1. As you promise each other, as the vows are sealed;
May you ever be faithful to the love revealed.
You have promised to cherish, to love and to hold;
May the promises keep you, all your lives enfold.

Chorus: You have promised each other this sacred moment,
To a lifetime of sharing in all you do.
May the Father in heaven smile upon you His children,
And bless the promise and keep you true.

2. You have promised each other, God in heav'n has heard;
Angels there have recorded, ev'ry spoken word.
In your hearts your intention is to always be true;
May the most holy promise, ev'ry day be new.
3
They have promised each other, all their lives to share
'Yours' and 'mine' shall be blended, into 'ours' so fair;
In a oneness belonging, what a blessing it is:
He will always be hers now, she is always his.
