1. Satan tells me that I only thought I got saved,
He tells me what a fool I have been;
But when my mind goes back to that old place where I prayed
I know that I've been born again.

Chorus:
Born again, free from sin
I'm happy night and day.
Makes me shout, there's no doubt,
I know that I've been born again.

2. Many times along the way, my faith has grown weak,
When burdens seem to rise on every hand;
But when I steal away in prayer, He answers my plea,
My every need He understands.
