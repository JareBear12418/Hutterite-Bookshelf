1. My latest sun is sinking fast, my race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past, my triumph has begun
Oh, come Angel Band come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
to my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
to my immortal home

SOLO
Oh bear my longing heart to Him who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin and gives me victory

Oh, come Angel Band come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
to my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
to my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
to my immortal home
