1. I have sailed the peaceful waters of the oceans deep and blue
I have held my breath and watched the western sunset's golden hue
I have flown above the mountain peaks the valleys wide and green
But your the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen.

Chorus:
You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love came true the day that I found you
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are.

2. I'll admit that I've been tempted by alluring magic charms
When a smile was flashed my way and stood before two open arms
But I turned and walked away because I love you like I do
You're the nearest thing to heaven, darling you

3. I have watched the silver raindrops fall to earth to cool the day
Saw a rainbow at twilight when the clouds had blown away
I love the pretty flowers but I cannot find their worth
You're the nearest thing to heaven, on this earth.
