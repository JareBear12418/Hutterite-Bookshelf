1. Sing a song (Sing a song)
Spread some cheer, (Spread some cheer,)
There are sad and lonely people everywhere;
Be a friend, (Be a friend,)
Show some love (Show some love,)
It will lift them from the dungeons of despair.

Chorus:
Show a little bit of love and kindness
Never go along with naked blindness,
Take a little time to reach for joy
And wear a happy face;
Sing a little bit when days are dreary,
Give a little help to a friend that's weary,
That's the way to make the world a happy place.

2. Offer help (Offer help)
Bring some help (Bring some help)
To the fainting and discouraged on life's road;
See a need (See a need)
Lend a hand (Lend a hand)
There are many who are crushed beneath their load.

3. Be a light (Be a light)
Show the way (Show the way)
Be a light within the night for those who stray;
Speak a word (Speak a word)
Loving word (Loving word)
That will bring them back to walk the narrow way.
