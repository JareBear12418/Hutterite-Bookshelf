As your children gather in peace
All the angels sing in heaven
In your temple all that I seek
Is to glimpse your holy presence

Chorus
All the heavens cannot hold you Lord
How much less to dwell in me?
I can only make my one desire,
Holding onto thee

2.
All the angels exalt you on high
What a kingdom to depart
But you left your throne in the sky
Just to live inside my heart

Repeat chorus
'Â¦
I will always make my one desire,
Holding onto thee
