1. God loves me dearly,
Grants me Salvation,
God loves me dearly,
Loves even me.

Chorus:
Therefore I'll say again:
God loves me dearly,
God loves me dearly,
Loves even me.

2. I was in bondage,
Sin, death, and darkness
God's love was working
To make me free.

3. He sent forth Jesus,
That true Redeemer,
He sent forth Jesus
And set me free.

4. Jesus my Savior,
Himself did offer,
Jesus my Savior
Paid all I owed.

5. Now will I praise Thee,
O Love Eternal;
Now will I praise Thee
All my life long.
