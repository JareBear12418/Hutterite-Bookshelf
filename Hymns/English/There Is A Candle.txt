1. There is a candle in every soul,
Some brightly burning, some dark and cold.
There is a Spirit who brings the fire,
Ignites a candle and makes it whole.
Carry your candle into the darkness,
Seek out the hopeless, confused and torn;
Hold high its light let everyone see it,
And use its flame to light up your world.

2. Discouraged brother, see how he's tried to-
Light his own candle, some other way;
See now our sister who so long has tried to-
Hold on to her candle, without a flame.
Carry your candle, into the darkness,
Seek out the lonely the tired and worn;
Hold high its light let everyone see it;
Take your candle, go light your world.

3. We are a family whose hearts are blazing,
We raise our flames, to light up the sky;
Praying to our Father, in the name of Jesus,
'Make us a beacon, in darkest times.'
Carry your candle into the darkness,
Seek out the helpless, deceived and poor;
Hold high its light let everyone see it;
Take your candle, go light your world.
