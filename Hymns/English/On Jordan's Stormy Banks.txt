1. On Jordan's Stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

Chorus:
We will rest in the fair and happy land, (by and by)
Just across on the evergreen shore, (evergreen shore,)
Sing the song of Moses and the Lamb, by and by,
And dwell with Jesus evermore.

2. O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns,
And scatters night away.

3. When shall I reach that happy place
And be forever blest?
When shall I see my Father's face,
And in His bosom rest?

4. Filled with delight, my raptured soul
Would here no longer stay;
Tho' Jordan's waves around me roll,
Fearless I'd launch away.
