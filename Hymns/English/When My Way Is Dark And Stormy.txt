1. When my way is dark and stormy,
And the clouds of sin I see;
Then I look to my Lord Jesus,
For I know he'll welcome me.

Chorus:
He tells me to be strong,
'In your hearts, I'll put a song;
Trust in me and I will guide you day by day,
I, your captain want to be.
On life's dark and storm tossed sea,
Take my hand, trust in me;' said my Lord.

2. When temptations 'round me gather,
And the way I nearly loose;
Then I put my trust in Jesus,
As for me, he'll guide me through.
