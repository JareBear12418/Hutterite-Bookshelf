1. I've been scorned by a neighbor whom I treasured,
I've been deceived by a friend I held dear;
So many times I just wanted to give up,
When I remember my Lord is right here.

Chorus:
Another hill and sometimes a mountain,
Another road with rocks to hurt my feet;
But when He walks along beside me,
I can face it there'll be no retreat.

2. I have questioned the loss of my loved ones
I wonder why it's happened to me;
But through prayers I found an answer
It was all quite plain to see.
