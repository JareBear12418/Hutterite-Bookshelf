1. The chains were fastened tight, down at the jail that night;
Still Paul and Silas would not be dismayed.
They said it's time to lift our voice,
Sing praises to the Lord;
Let's prove that we will trust him, come what may.

Chorus:
God loves to hear you sing,
When the waves are crashing 'round you.
When there's fiery darts around you,
When despair is all you see.
God wants to hear your voice
When the wisest man has spoken,
And says your circumstance is as hopeless as can be;
That's when God wants to hear you sing.

2. God loves to hear our praise, on our cheerful days,
When the pleasant times outweigh the bad by far.
But when suffering comes along and we still sing him songs,
That is when we bless the Father's heart.
