Chorus:
I'm so glad, I'm part of the family of God,
I've been washed in the fountain, cleansed by His blood;
Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod,
For I'm part of the family, the family of God.

1. You'll notice we say brother or sister 'round here,
It's because we're a family and these folks are so dear;
When one has a heartache we all share the tears,
And rejoice in each vict'ry in this family so dear.

2. From the doors of an orphanage to the house of the King,
No longer an outcast, a new song I sing;
From rags unto riches, from the weak to the strong,
I'm not worthy to be here, but praise God I belong.
