1. Some folks I know by their name;
Some I just know their face;
Some are known by their fame;
Others known by their race.
But in the kingdom of our Lord,
Each soul has their place,
In my mind I have no doubt,
By name we've been called out.

Chorus: And we've been: ... Called out
for a purpose, ... Called out
to be a servant, ... Called out
to lift the standards,  ... Called out
to raise the banner,  ... Called out
to be a witness,  ... Called out
to show forgiveness, ... Called out
From this world, child, you've been called out.

2. In the prison walls on that day,
The jailor bound up their feet.
Stripped of their garments there they lay,
Bleeding from where they were beat.
Around about midnight, Paul began to pray;
Silas started to sing,
The earth shook about, the doors swung open wide,
God said, 'You've been called out':
