1. Away by the river so clear,
The ladies were winding their way,
And Pharoah's daughter, stepped down in the waters,
To bathe in the cool of the day;
And before it was dark, she opened the ark,
And found the sweet infant was there.

2. And away by the river so blue,
The infant was lonely and sad,
She took him in pity and thought him so pretty,
And it made little Moses so glad;
She called him her own, her beautiful son,
And sent for a nurse that was near.

3. And away by the river so clear,
They carried the beautiful child,
To his own tender mother, his sister and brother,
Little Moses looked happy and smiled;
His mother so good, done all that she could,
To rear him and teach him with care.

4. Now away by the sea that was red,
Little Moses the servant of God,
While In him confided, the sea was divided,
As upward he lifted his rod;
The Jews, safely crossed, while Pharaoh's host
Was drowned in the water and lost.

5. And away in the mountain so high,
The last one that ever might be,
While in him victorious, his life was most glorious,
He could over the Jordan be free;
When his labors did cease he departed in peace,
And rested in heavens above.
