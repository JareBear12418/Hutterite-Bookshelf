When I think of how He came so far from glory;
Came and walked among the lowly, such as I,
To suffer shame and such disgrace; on Mount Calvr'y take my place,
Then I ask myself a question, 'Who am I?'

CH:Who am I? That the King should bleed and die for.
Who am I? That He would pray, 'Not My will, Thine Lord'.
The answer I may never know; why He ever loved me so,
That to an old rugged cross He'd go.  Who am I?

When I'm reminded of His words; 'I'll leave you never,
Just be true, I'll give to you a life forever,'
I wonder what I could have done, to deserve God's only Son?
Fight my battles till they're won; who am I?
