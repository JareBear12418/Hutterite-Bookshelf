1. I'm going to that kingdom,
To be with my Jesus forever;
No greater vision could I see,
Than to set my eyes on eternity.

2. I'm going with my Jesus,
He's bringing me home Himself;
He's leading and guiding me everyday,
On that narrow path of His perfect way.

3. O, how I love my Jesus,
My shepherd, my king, and my Lord;
I want to thank Him with all of my heart,
For the glorious plans and for making me part.
