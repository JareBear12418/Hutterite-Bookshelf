1. When sometimes in heaven glory,
I am ever in God's care;
Will there be someone to meet me,
That I've won for Jesus there.

Chorus:
Shall I find some stars I wonder,
In my crown in gloryland;
Or shall I be empty handed,
When before my God I stand.

2. Millions now in darkness dying,
Lost for all eternity;
Give me grace that I may bring them,
Message of salvation free.

3. Savior dear, O let me ever,
Be a shining light for thee;
So that every lost and dying,
Home from darkness find their way.

4. I must go, God's love compels me,
To a world of sin and need;
And for heaven rescue many,
From the sinful paths they lead.
