1. Thank-you, Lord, for granting new beginnings,
For special dreams which silently come true;
Our love today from you so freely given,
We give in grateful service back to you.

Chorus: Father, make our home a touch of heaven,
A quiet vale of happiness to share;
That whoe'er we should meet upon our journey,
Will feel a warm and hearty welcome there.

2. We cast our gaze into an unknown future,
We face the sunrise walking side by side;
The path we tread you planned for us together;
Grant our request, be thou our constant guide.

3. Should the clouds o'er shadow our horizon,
Then help us see the sparkle in the rain;
Let flowers breathe soft fragrance on our pathway,
To remind us of your love to us again.

4. When evening falls we'll linger in the twilight;
Please Father, rest your blessing on us there,
To cherish as the spark we've shared in living,
Still loving then, as now, this is our prayer.
