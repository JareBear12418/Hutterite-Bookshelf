Chorus: Who put the tears in the eyes of the Lamb?
Who crowned the head with thorns till it bled,
Of the great I Am?
Who drove the nails in His loving hands?
Down through the years, who put the tears
In the eyes of the Lamb?

1. As Jesus was walking the last mile to Calvary's hill,
Peter had denied Him, they cried, 'Crucify Him!'
But He was in His Father's will.
As He hung in silence, our faith in the balance,
I look back and I realize,
When He said, 'Forgive them;' and cried, 'It is finished,'
There were tears in my Father's eyes.

2. When I lived in darkness, my life filled with blindness and sin,
I didn't serve Him or show that I loved Him,
But praise God, I changed my life then.
Dear friend, if you're straying, your life has no meaning,
Repent and change your life now.
Don't put off salvation for He died to save you;
Don't put tears in my Father's eyes.
