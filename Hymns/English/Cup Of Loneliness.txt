1. I see Christian pilgrims so redeemed from sin,
Called out of darkness a new life to begin;
Were you ever in the valley,
Where the way is dark and dim;
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him?

2. Did you ever have them laugh at you,
And say it was a fake,
The stand that you so boldly,
For the Lord did take?
Did you ever have them mock at you
And laugh in ways quite grim;
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him?

3. Did you ever try to preach, then hold fast and pray,
And even when you did it,
There did not seem a way;
And you lost all courage, then lost all your will?
Did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him?

4. Oh my friend, 'tis bitter sweet,
While here on earthly sod,
To follow in the footsteps,
That our dear Savior trod;
To suffer with the Savior,
And when it's dark and dim,
To drink from the cup of loneliness with him.
