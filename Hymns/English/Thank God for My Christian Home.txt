1. If you look on my family in pity
And wonder how we struggle along
And your eyes can see all my riches
Thank God for my Christian home.

Chorus: When I'm sad and discouraged from failure
And feel the whole world is against me
And everything is wrong
All I need for courage is to whisper
Thank God for my Christian home.

2. I'm not seeking for riches nor power
In this world I can't call my own
But I'm laying up treasures in Heaven
Where no sorrow will ever be known.

3. I will leave this old world like I found it
Taking with me no silver nor gold
But the strong hand of death has the power
To break the circle of my Christian home.
