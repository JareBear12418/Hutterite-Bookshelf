1. There is beauty all around,
When there's love at home;
There is joy in ev'ry sound,
When there's love at home.
Peace and plenty here abide,
Smiling sweet on ev'ry side;
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,
When there's love at home;
Love at home, Love at home,
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,
When there's love at home.

2. In the cottage there is joy,
When there's love at home;
Hate and envy ne'er annoy,
When there's love at home.
Roses blossom 'neath our feet,
All the earth's a garden sweet,
Making life a bliss complete,
When there's love at home;
Love at home, Love at home,
Making life a bliss complete,
When there's love at home.

3. Kindly heaven smiles above,
When there's love at home;
All the earth is filled with love,
When there's love at home.
Sweeter sings the brooklet by,
Brighter beams the azure sky:
Oh, there's One who smiles on high,
When there's love at home;
Love at home, Love at home,
Oh, there's One who smiles on high,
When there's love at home.

4. Jesus, show Thy mercy mine,
Then there's love at home;
Sweetly whisper I am Thine,
Then there's love at home.
Source of love, Thy cheering light
Far exceeds the sun so bright
Can dispel the gloom of night;
Then there's love at home;
Love at home, Love at home,
Can dispel the gloom of night,
Then there's love at home.
