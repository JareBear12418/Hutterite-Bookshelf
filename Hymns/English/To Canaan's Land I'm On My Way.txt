1. To Canaan's land I'm on my way,
Where the soul of man never dies;
My darkest night will turn to day,
Where the soul of man never dies.

Chorus:
Dear friends, there'll be no sad farewells,
There'll be no tear dimmed eyes,
Where all is peace and joy and love,
And the soul of man never dies.

2. A rose is blooming there for me,
Where the soul of man never dies;
And I will spend eternity,
Where the soul of man never dies.

3. A love light beams across the foam,
Where the soul of man never dies;
It shines to light the shores of home,
Where the soul of man never dies.

4. I'm on my way to that fair land,
Where the soul of man never dies;
Where there will be no parting hand,
And the soul of man never dies.
