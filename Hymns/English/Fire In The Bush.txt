1. There's a fire in the bush a burning,
Burning bright with a clear white light;
There's a fire in the bush a burning,
And it burns for you and me.
Burning, (burning) burning, (burning)
Burning, (burning) burning, (burning)
There's a fire in the bush a burning,
And it burns for you and me.

2. There's a voice from the fire a calling,
Calling clear to the listening ear;
There's a voice from the fire a calling,
And He calls for you and me.
Calling, (calling) calling, (calling)
Calling, (calling) calling, (calling)
There's a voice from the fire a calling,
And He calls for you and me.

3. Give me strength to rise and follow;
Strength to do what my soul must do;
Give me strength to rise and follow,
Lord, to rise and follow you.
Follow, (follow) follow, (follow)
Follow, (follow) follow, (follow)
Give me strength to rise and follow,
Lord, to rise and follow you.
