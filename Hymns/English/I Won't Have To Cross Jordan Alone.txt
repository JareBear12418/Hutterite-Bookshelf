1. When I come to the river at ending of day,
When the last winds of sorrow have blown;
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way,
I won't have to cross Jordon alone.

Chorus:
I won't have to cross Jordon alone,
Jesus died for my sins to atone;
When the darkness I see, He'll be waiting for me,
I won't have to cross Jordon alone.

2. Often times I'm forsaken and weary and sad,
When it seems that my friends have all gone;
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad
I won't have to cross Jordon alone.

3. Though the billows of sorrow and trouble may sweep
Christ the Savior will care for His own;
Till the end of the journey, my soul He will keep,
I won't have to cross Jordon alone.
