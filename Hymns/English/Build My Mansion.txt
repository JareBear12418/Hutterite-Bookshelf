1. I have no castle, no earthly kingdom
But my cabin will do till I get home;
My mansion's yonder on the hills of gold,
Oh, I hope my mansion sits near God's throne.

Chorus:
Build my mansion next door to Jesus,
And tell the angels, I'm coming home;
It doesn't matter who lives around me
Just so my mansion sits near the throne.

2. My mother's mansion may be close by me,
Across the golden avenue;
She was the first one to teach me of heaven
And the very first, Lord, to tell me about you.
