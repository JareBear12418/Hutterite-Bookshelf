1. Lord I don't want to do one thing on my own
Put me where you want me Lord, it's where I belong
Give me the strength, to do thy perfect will
When I'm in the lowest valley I can climb the highest hill.

Chorus: Lord I want to be what you want me to be
Lord I want to do what you want me to do
Lord I want to stay in the center of thy will
When I'm in the lowest valley I can climb the highest hill.

2. This world gets more wicked everyday
People's hearts are growing cold, forgotten how to pray
If I live to be a hundred, I'll be holding to His hand
Until He comes to take me home, to that promised land.
