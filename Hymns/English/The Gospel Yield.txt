1. Oh God's Word is like a seed that has fallen on the ground,
And the soil that is prepared will bring its yield,
Maybe thirty, maybe sixty or perhaps a hundredfold,
Can be gathered from the acres of life's field.

Chorus:
May the songs that I sing have a true gospel ring,
May my life be molded in the gospel mold,
May the crop from my field bear the true gospel yield,
Of a thirty, sixty or a hundredfold.

2. Lord, You gave me all I have and I know it's not mine,
You just gave it to me for a while to hold,
Help me Lord that I may bring it all back to You,
Gaining thirty, sixty or a hundred fold.

3. May I clear the rocks and thorns from the corners of my field,
And remove whatever's barren, hard and cold,
May the cares of this life and the riches of this world,
Ne'er detain the thirty, sixty, hundredfold.
