1. Christ, our Redeemer, died on the cross,
Died for the sinner, paid all his due;
All who receive Him need never fear,
Yes, He will pass, will pass over you.

Chorus:
When I see the blood,
(When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
(When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
(When I see the blood,
I will pass, I will pass over you, (over you.)

2. Chiefest of sinners Jesus can save,
As He has promised, so will He do;
O sinner, hear Him, trust in His Word,
Then He will pass, will pass over you.

3. Judgment is coming, all will be there,
Who have rejected, who have refused;
O sinner, hasten, let Jesus in,
Then God will pass, will pass over you.

4. O what compassion, O boundless love,
Jesus hath power, Jesus is true;
All who obey are save from the storm,
O He will pass, will pass over you.
