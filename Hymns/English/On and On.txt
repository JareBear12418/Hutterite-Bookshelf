1. My Savior daily walks with me because I trust His love
In all that stands His hand I see
It points to heaven above
I will follow Him through shadows dim
Or in the sunshine bright
And on we walk together (And He)
Leads my step all right
Chorus
On and on we walk together
(Onwe walk together)
Christ is ever by my side
(Christ is by my side)
And I fear no stormy weather
(Fearnostormy weather)
For He is a faithful guide
 (For He is a faithful guide)
You can never find another
(You can 't find another)
But the waves obey His will
(Waves o - bey His will)
And He speaks to you my brother
(Speaks toyou my brother)
There is peace in Him still
(Come and hear His peace, be still.)

2. Upon my blessed Lord I lean
My all to Him confine
No more can shadows come between
I'm walking by His side
In true faith I will on Him rely
He makes my burden light
And on we walk together (And He)
Leads my steps all right.
