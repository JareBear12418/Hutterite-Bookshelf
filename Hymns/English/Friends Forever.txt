1. Now it's time for us to say
Good-bye for just a while
So until we meet again
May God's love make us smile

Chorus: And we'll be friends forever
Jesus and you and me
He ties our hearts together
And friends we'll always be

2. Now when you see the sun you'll know
I see the same one too
And when you see the stars they'll say
Hello from me to you.
(repeat chorus)
