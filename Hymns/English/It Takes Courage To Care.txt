1. You can close your heart to others
And no heartache you will share.
For to sympathize, brings sorrow;
You're afraid to really care.
But just think, what might have happened,
If the one on Calvary
Had been afraid to care for you and me.

Chorus: It takes courage to care,
It takes strength to sympathize;
It takes courage to show pity,
Yes, it takes a man to cry.
There was one who walked before us
Up the hill of Calvary,
He had the courage to care for you and me.

2. You may build a shell around you,
Until no one can get through.
And your friends are only those,
Who can do the best for you.
You may think this way is easy,
But the price you pay is high:
For you're giving up the best things in life.

3. If you feel the lack of courage,
Just get down upon your knees.
Humbly, ask the Lord to fill your heart,
He'll give you all you need.
You'll be able to help others
Who are lost in dark despair;
You'll find courage and power to really care.

4. The true measure of a person
Is revealed by how he cares.
For true love is never weakened
When it shares another's tears.
It is courage born of knowledge
Of the worth of every soul,
And believes that God, restores and makes us whole.
