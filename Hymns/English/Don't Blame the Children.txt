1. Don't blame the children wherever they're found,
Drinking and gambling and running around;
If by their conduct they're bringing you shame,
Is it the children or the parents to blame?

2. Where are your children, your pride and your joy?
Where is your girl, where is your boy?
If by their conduct they're bringing you shame,
Is it the children or the parents to blame?

3. We read in the paper, we hear on the air,
Of killing and stealing and crime everywhere;
We sigh and we say as we notice the trend,
This young generation where will it all end.

4. Too many books not fit to be read,
Too many of evil on things that are said;
Too many children encouraged to roam,
Too many parents who won't stay at home.

5. Now kids, don't make movies, they don't write the books,
Nor paint the gay pictures of gangsters and crooks;
They don't make the liquor, they don't run the bars,
They don't make the laws and they don't buy the cars.

6. By law of the blameless the good book makes known,
Who is there amongst us to cast the first stone;
And in how many cases we find that it's true,
The label, 'Delinquent' fits older folks, too.
