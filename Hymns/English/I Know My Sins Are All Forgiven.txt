I know my sins are all forgiven. (3)
I am on my way to Heaven.
All my sins are taken away.  Praise the Lord!

I'm going to see my Saviour there. (3)
All the joys of Heaven I'll share.
All my sins are taken away.  Praise the Lord!

Oh, the devil is mad, though I am glad. (3)
He lost a soul he thought he had.
All my sins are taken away.  Praise the Lord!

You better not learn to dance and drink. (3)
They're more dangerous than you think.
All my sins are taken away.  Praise the Lord!
