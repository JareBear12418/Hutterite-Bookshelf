1. The seed I have scattered in springtime with weeping,
And watered with tears and with dews from on high;
Another may shout when the harvester's reaping,
Shall gather my grain in the 'sweet by and by.'

Chorus:
Over and over, yes, deeper and deeper
My heart is pierced thru with life's sorrowing cry,
But the tears of the sower and songs of the reaper
Shall mingle together in joy by and by.
By and by, (By and by,) by and by, (By and by,)
By and by, (By and by,) by and by, (By and by,)
Yes the tears of the sower and songs of the reaper
Shall gather my grain in the 'sweet by and by.'

2. Another may reap what in springtime I've planted,
Another rejoice in the fruits of my pain,
Not knowing my tears when in summer I fainted
While toiling sadhearted in sunshine and rain.

3. The thorns will have choked, and the summer suns blasted
The most of the seed which in springtime I've sown;
But the Lord who has watched while my weary toil lasted
Will give me a harvest for what I have done.
