1. My God and I go in the field together,
We walk and talk as good friends should and do;
We clasp our hands, our voices ring with laughter
My God and I walk thru the meadow's hue;
We clasp our hands, our voices ring with laughter
My God and I walk thru the meadow's hue.

2. He tells me of the years that went before me,
When heav'nly plans were made for me to be,
When all was but a dream of dim conception
To come to life, earth's verdant glory see;
When all was but a dream of dim conception
To come to life, earth's verdant glory see.

3. My God and I will go for aye together,
We'll walk and talk and jest as good friends do;
This earth will pass, and with it common trifles
But God and I will go unendingly;
This earth will pass, and with it common trifles
But God and I will go unendingly.
