When this passing world is done
When has sunk yon glaring sun
When I stand with Christ on high
Looking over life's history
Then, Lord, shall I fully know
Not till then how much I owe.

When I stand before the throne
Dressed in beauty not my own
When I see Thee as Thou art
Love Thee with unsinning heart
Then, Lord, shall I fully know
Not till then how much I owe.

When the praise of heav'n I hear
Loud as thunder to the ear
Loud as many water's noise
Sweet as harp's melodious voice
Then, lord, shall I fully know
Not till then how much I owe.

Even on earth as through a glass
Darkly let Thy glory pass
Make forgiveness feel so sweet
Make Thy Spirit's help so meet
Even on earth Lord make me know
Something of how much I owe'
