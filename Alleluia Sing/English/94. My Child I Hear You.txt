When heartaches attack me like lions in rage
I haste to find You at each close of day
You reach out to touch me and hold me so near
With hands soft and tender, You're drying each tear.

CHORUS

My child I hear you, my child I see you
My child I love you, come closer to Me
Yes God, I feel You, yes God, I sense You
Yes God, I love You, come closer to me.

Then like from nowhere my friend sends a smile
Giving me courage to make life worthwhile
I thank you, dear Savior, for giving to me
My friends, but most, Lord, I thank You for You.
