Nearer, my God to Thee, nearer to Thee
E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God to Thee
Nearer, my God to Thee, nearer to Thee.

Though like a wanderer, daylight all gone
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone
Yet in my dreams I'll be, nearer, my God to Thee
Nearer, my God to Thee, nearer to Thee.

There let the way appear, steps up to heav'n
All that Thou sendest me in mercy giv'n
Angels to beckon me, nearer, my God to Thee
Nearer, my God to Thee, nearer to Thee.

Then with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise
So by my woes to be, nearer, my God to Thee
Nearer, my God to Thee, nearer to Thee.

Or if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky
Caught up to meet my King, swiftly I fly
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God to Thee
Nearer, my God to Thee, nearer to Thee.
