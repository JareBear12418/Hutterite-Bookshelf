Back through the years I go wandering once again
Back through the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put those rags to use.

There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together, sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of.

As she sewed she told a story from the Bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mama blessed it with a kiss.

My coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Made only from rags, but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me.

So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

I couldn't understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told about the love my mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them of the story mama told me while she sewed
How my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes.

But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
That one was only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me.
