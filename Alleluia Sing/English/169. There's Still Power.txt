There's still cleansing power in the precious blood
There's still power in the blood of the Lamb
And we are trying hard to get this message through the land
There's still power in the blood of the Lamb.

CHORUS

There is power (cleansing power)
In the blood (precious blood)
With this blood each sinner's soul can be set free
I'm so glad that in God's plan, He has offered every man
Cleansing power in the blood of the Lamb.

Through the blood God makes the vilest sinner clean
Yes, it's all through the blood of the Lamb
And all throughout the ages men have been redeemed
There's still power in the blood of the Lamb.
