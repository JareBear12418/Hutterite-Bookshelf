Once I was bound by the chains of sin
I had no hope and no peace within
But Jesus came in my life one day (in my life one day)
Now I can say that the lord is real
And His presence now I can truly feel
For He has come in my life to stay (in my life to stay).

CHORUS

Truly I can say (truly I can say)
That the Lord is real (that the Lord is real)
For His presence now (holy presence now)
In my heart I feel (in my heart I feel)
Since He saved my soul (since He saved my soul)
With His love appeal (with His love appeal)

I'm so glad to tell you I know 'tis real (yes, I know 'tis real).
It was a glad, happy day for me
When He came in and my heart was freed
I shouted glory to God most high (yes, to God most high)
He filled my soui with redeeming love
Pointed out the way to the courts above
Where I shall see Him some by and by (happy by and by).

No longer now am I prone to stray
For I am now in the glory way
So sweetly walking with Christ my King (with my lord and King)
I'm headed for that eternal goal
Heaven's happy home of the ransomed soul
With saints and angels His praise to sing (happy praise to sing).
