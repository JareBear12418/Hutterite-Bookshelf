He left the splendors of Heaven for me
And He took on the likeness of man
He came to live in an ungodly world
Though spotless the Man knew no sin
All heaven's foundations were shaken that day
But for changing His mind He could not
Though He knew exactly what He would go through
Oh, He must have loved me a lot.

CHORUS

And how many tears have I brought to His eyes
I've hurt Him more often than not
Still infinite mercy responds to my cry
Oh, He must have loved me a lot.

He went through the shame of a trial alone
Through the darkness of death and the grave
He went through the pain of denial and scorn
The outcast a beggar to save
If I had the power to turn back the time
Make amends for the things I forgot
A lifetime of goodness could never atone
Oh, He must have loved me a lot.
