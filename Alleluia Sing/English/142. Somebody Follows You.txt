Brother, along on the highway of life
Strive to be good and true
Take Jesus with you to aid in the strife
Somebody follows you.

CHORUS

Somebody follows you (follows you)
Watching the things you do (you do)
Walk in the light and be pure in His sight
Somebody follows you.

Little you think when you turn from the right
Who sees the things you do
But others watch you by day and by night
Somebody follows you.

Never forget that the Lord keeps His own
So to His words be true
Many are longing the way to be shown
Oh, let them follow you.
