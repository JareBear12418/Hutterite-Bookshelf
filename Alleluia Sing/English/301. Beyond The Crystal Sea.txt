There's a place of dazzling beauty
No human eye has ever seen
With gates of pearl and streets paved with gold
It's a land of milk and honey
Oh, it's more than just a dream
It's the land of life beyond the crystal sea.

CHORUS

It's the land of life, where living is forever
Where the sting of death will claim no victory
We are nothing more than just a passing shadow
Till we reach the land of living beyond the crystal sea.

The sun is nothing but a legend
In this paradise of dreams
The Lamb will be the only light we need
It's soothing walls of jasper
Built by hands unseen
It's the land of life beyond the crystal sea.
