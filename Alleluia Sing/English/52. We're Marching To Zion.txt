Come we that love the Lord
And let our joys be known
Join in the song with sweet accord
Join in the song with sweet accord
And thus surround the throne
And thus surround the throne.

CHORUS

We're marching to Zion
Beautiful, beautiful Zion
We're marching upward to Zion
The beautiful city of God.

Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God
But children of the heavenly King
But children of the heavenly King
May speak their joys abroad
May speak their joys abroad.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heavenly fields
Before we reach the heavenly fields
Or walk the golden streets
Or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound
And every tear be dry
We're marching through Immanuel's ground
We're marching through Immanuel's ground
To fairer worlds on high
To fairer worlds on high'
