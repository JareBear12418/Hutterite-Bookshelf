I am thinking today of that beautiful land
I shall reach when the sun goeth down
When through wonderful grace by my Savior I stand
Will there be any stars in my crown?

CHORUS

Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down
When I wake with the blessed in the mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown?

In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray
Let me watch as a winner of souls
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
When His praise like the sea billows roll.

Oh what joy it will be when His face I behold
Living gems at His feet to lay down
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold
Should there be any stars in my crown.
