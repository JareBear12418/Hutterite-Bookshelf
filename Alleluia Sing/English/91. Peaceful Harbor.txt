I've been sailing the seas for most of all these years
Riding the crest of a wave made of tears
I've been drifting on a troubled sea, traveling aimlessly
Till I put my anchor down on peaceful harbor.

Well the winds of despair were blowing on my face
Till the day I felt the gentle breeze of amazing grace
So I chartered a brand new course, let the Savior be my guiding force
Then I put my anchor down on peaceful harbor.

CHORUS

Now I've emptied all my cargo on the docks of Heaven's gate
Troubled seas I'm traveling no more
My sailing life is over, my legs have felt the land
I'm standing now upon the other shore.

Well I'm watching the sun set down on a peaceful sea
Never in all my life have I felt so free
Now I'm standing upon the shore, sailing out no more
Since I put my anchor down on peaceful harbor'
