There's a right and wrong way to press along
And the right one you must take
If you want a friend at the journey's end
And meet Him there someday.

CHORUS

Never stop (never stop or wait) lest you be too late
To inherit the golden crown
You must walk (you must walk each day) in the gospel way
If your works of God be found.

Do you love your neighbor as yourself
Do you cheat him not in trade
Would your conscience groan on tomorrow's dawn
Should you meet him on the way.

Never do good deeds for the praise of man
Giving gold that they might see
But in secret give and in secret pray
He'll reward you openly.
