My sheep know my voice
And the path that I take
They follow wherever I go
My sheep know My voice
And come at My call
But a stranger's voice do they not know.

CHORUS

My sheep know My voice (My sheep know My voice, day by day)
And day by day (My sheep know My voice, day by day)
They abide in the fold (they abide in the fold, they go not astray)
And go not astray (abide in the fold, they go not astray)
They love Me because (they love Me because I made them My choice)
I have made them My choice (they love Me because I made them My choice)
And they follow My call (they follow My call, they follow My call)
For My sheep know My voice (My sheep know My voice).

My sheep know My voice
And the pastures of green
Where I lead them so often to feed
My sheep know My voice
And the cool sparkling stream
Where beside its still waters I lead.

My sheep know My voice
And the valley of death
Through which I shall lead them someday
But no danger nor harm
Can touch one of them
For I will be with them always.
