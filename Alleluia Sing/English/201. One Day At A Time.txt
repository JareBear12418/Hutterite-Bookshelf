I'm only human, I'm just a pilgrim
Help me believe in what I could be
And all that I am
Show me the stairway I have to climb
Lord for my sake, teach me to take
One day at a time.

CHORUS

One day at a time, sweet Jesus
That's all I'm asking from You
Give me the strength
To do everyday what I have to do
Yesterday's gone, sweet Jesus
And tomorrow may never be mine
Help me today, show me the way
One day at a time.

Do You remember when You walked among men
Jesus, You know if you're looking below
It's worse now than then
Pushing and shoving, violence and crime
Lord for my sake, teach me to take
One day at a time.
