I need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord
No tender voice like Thine can peace afford
I need Thee, oh I need Thee, every hour I need Thee
Oh bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour, stay Thou near by
Temptations lose their power when Thou art nigh
I need Thee, oh I need Thee, every hour I need Thee
Oh bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour, in joy or pain
Come quickly and abide, or life is vain
I need Thee, oh I need Thee, every hour I need Thee
Oh bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour, most Holy One
Oh make me Thine indeed, Thou blessed Son
I need Thee, oh I need Thee, every hour I need Thee
Oh bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.
