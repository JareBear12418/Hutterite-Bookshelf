I am amazed He let me live
Without my heart, without my life I would not give
To know that I deserved to die
I am amazed God is so good He let me live.

CHORUS

Beginning with creation, to completion of salvation
I know the heavenly Father has a plan
When we're faithful and pray steady then I know that we'll be ready
When we're called upon to enter gloryland.

I am amazed at God's great love
He sent His Son down here from up above
He came to teach and to forgive
And to make things right again with God so we can live.

I am amazed at the gifts of God
He gives me every breath I take, He's with me every step I trod
I thank the Lord for His saving grace
He helps me live so that one day I'll see His face.

I am amazed God is so good He let me live!
