I have found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole
In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay
He tells me every care on Him to roll.

CHORUS

He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

Oh He all my griefs has taken and all my sorrows borne
In temptation He's my strong and mighty tow'r
I have all for Him forsaken and all my idols torn
From my heart, and now He keeps me by His pow'r
Though all the world forsake me and Satan tempt me sore
Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal.

He will never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill
Then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll.
