Although I cannot see the way
O'er life's tempestuous sea
I know that Jesus is my friend
And that He'll pilot me.

CHORUS

He'll pilot me (by His hand, He'll pilot me)
From day to day (over life's tempestuous sea)
When blinded eyes (when my blinded eyes can't see)
Can't see the way (cannot see the way, the way)
Then come what may (then come what may, come what may)
On life's dark sea (on life's dark and stormy sea)
My blessed Lord (my dear Lord, blessed Lord)
Will pilot me (He will pilot, pilot me)

Dark clouds may gather in the sky
And rough the sea may be
His love shall ever be my song
I know He'll pilot me.

Dear Lord, whate'er the storm may be
I'll simply trust in Thee
Relying on Thy love so true
To safely pilot me.
