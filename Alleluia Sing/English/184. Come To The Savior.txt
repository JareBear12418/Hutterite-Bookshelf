Come to the Savior, make no delay
Here in His word He has shown us the way
Here in our midst He's standing today
Tenderly saying come.

CHORUS

Joyful, joyful will the meeting be
When from sin our hearts are pure and free
And we shall gather, Savior, with Thee
In our eternal home.

Suffer the children, oh hear His voice
Let every heart leap forth and rejoice
And let us freely make Him our choice
Do not delay but come.

Think once again, He's with us today
Heed now His blessed commands and obey
Hear now His accents tenderly say
Will you my children come?'
