Somewhere just across the Jordan river
There's a place of everlasting joy and peace
Where the tree of life is blooming there forever
And the crown of life is waiting there for me.

CHORUS

That sounds like home to me
Like where I want to be
There'll be no tears to fill our eyes again
The hills will echo with the story
As we sing out His grace and glory
Where the saints of God will be
That sounds like home to me.

They say there's mansions there inside that city
A crystal river flowing by the tree of life
No pain or disappointment there to hurt us
And Jesus Christ himself will be the light.
