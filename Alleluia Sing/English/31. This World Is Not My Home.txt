This world is not my home, I'm just a-passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.

CHORUS

Oh Lord You know I have no friend like you
If Heaven's not my home, then Lord what willi do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.

Just over in Gloryland we'll live eternally
The saints on every hand are shouting victory
Their songs of sweetest praise drift back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
