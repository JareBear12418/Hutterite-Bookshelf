Twilight is stealing over the sea
Shadows are falling dark on the lee
Borne on the night, wind's voices of yore
Come from that far off shore.

CHORUS

Faraway beyond the starlit skies
Where the love light never, never dies
Gleameth a mansion filled with delight
Sweet happy home so bright.

Voices of loved ones, songs of the past
Still linger 'round me while life shall last
Lonely I wander, sadly I roam
Seeking that far off home.

Come in the twilight, come, come to me
Bringing some message over the sea
Cheering my pathway while here I roam
Seeking that far off home.
