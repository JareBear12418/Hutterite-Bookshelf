God forgave my sin in Jesus' name
I was born again in Jesus' name
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His love as He told me to.

CHORUS

He said, 'Freely, freely you have received
Freely, freely give
Go in My name and because you believe
Others will know that I live.'

All power is giv'n in Jesus' name
In earth, in heaven, in Jesus' name
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His love as He told me to.
