Holy God, we praise Thy name
Lord of all, we bow before Thee
All on earth Thy scepter claim
All in heav'n above adore Thee
Infinite Thy vast domain
Everlasting is Thy reign.

Hark, the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising
Cherubim and seraphim
In unceasing chorus praising
Fill the heav'ns with sweet accord
Holy, holy, holy Lord.

Lo, the apostolic train
Joins Thy sacred name to hallow
Prophets swell the glad refrain
And the white robed martyrs follow
And from morn to set of sun
Through the Church the song goes on.

Holy Father, Holy Son
Holy Spirit, three we name Thee
While in essence only one
Undivided God we claim Thee
And adoring bend the knee
While we sing our praise to Thee.
