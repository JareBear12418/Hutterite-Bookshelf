There's a battle cry being sounded here
By the royal army of the Lord
Soldiers march to the rhythm of the Lord's command
And this promise that is written in His word.

CHORUS

We shall overcome, we shall triumph
We shall stand in the victory as one
Calvary's hill's been conquered by the Lord and King
So the victory is already won.

There are times so often in the battle's rage
When the fighting will light the darkened sky
That's the time I focus on the Word of God
And can clearly read the final battle cry.
