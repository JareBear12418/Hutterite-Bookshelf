Would you be poured out like wine upon the altar for Me
Would you be broken like bread to feed the hungry
Would you be so one with Me that you would do just as I will
Would you be light and life and love My Word fulfill?

Yes, I'll be poured out like wine upon the altar for You
Yes, I'll be broken like bread to feed the hungry
Yes, I'll be so one with You that I would do just as You will
Yes, I'll be light and life and love Your World fulfill.
