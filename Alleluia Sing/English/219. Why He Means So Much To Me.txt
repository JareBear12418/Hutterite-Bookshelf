If you were blind and then could see
If you were bound and then set free
Then you'd understand why Jesus means so much to me
If you were hurt and then were healed
If by His grace Christ was revealed
Then you'd understand why He means so much to me.

CHORUS

I love the Lord because He died for me on Calvary
I love the Lord because His power sets the sinner free
Although I cannot comprehend, I know His love is without end
Now you'll understand why He means so much to me.

If you were lost and then were found
If you were deaf and then heard sound
Then you'd understand why Jesus means so much to me
If you were dead and then felt life
That's how it feels when you find Christ
Then you'd understand why He means so much to me. '
