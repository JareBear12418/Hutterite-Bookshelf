There came a sound from Heaven as a rushing mighty wind
It filled their hearts with singing and gave them peace within
The prophet gave this promise: the spirit will descend
And from your inner being, a river with no end.

There is a river that flows from deep within
There is a fountain that frees a soul from sin
Come to this water, there is a vast supply
There is a river that never shall run dry.

There was a thirsty woman who was drawing from a well
Her life was ruined and wasted, her soul was bound for hell
Then she met the Master who told of her great sin
And if you drink this water you'll never thirst again.

There is a river that flows from God above
There is a fountain that's filled with His great love
Come to this water, there is a vast supply
There is a river that never shall run dry.
