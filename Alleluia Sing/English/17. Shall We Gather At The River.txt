Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel feet have trod
With its crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God.

CHORUS

Yes, we'll gather at the river
The beautiful, the beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God.

On the margin of the river
Washing up its silver spray
We will walk and worship ever
All the happy golden days.

'Ere we reach the shining river
Lay we every burden down
Grace our spirits will deliver
And provide a robe and crown.

On the bosom of the river
Where the Savior King we own
We shall meet and sorrow never
'Neath the glory of the throne.

Soon we'll gather at the river
Soon our pilgrimage will cease
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With a melody of peace.
