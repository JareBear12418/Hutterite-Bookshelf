CHORUS

Keep your eyes on Jesus
When the tidal waves of trouble 'round you roll
Keep your eyes on Jesus
He will calm the storms of life that toss your soul.

Living in a world that's full of sorrow
We are tried and tempted every day
Knowing not the secrets of tomorrow
We find rescue when we watch and pray.

One night upon the sea of Galilee
Men were being tossed by angry winds
Then came Jesus walking on the water
Bidding them 'It's I, be not afraid.'
