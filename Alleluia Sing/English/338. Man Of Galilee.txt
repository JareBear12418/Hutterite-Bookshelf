In a manger long ago, I know it was really so
A babe was born to save a man from sin
John saw Him on the shore, as the Lamb forevermore
It was Christ, the Man of Galilee.

CHORUS

Oh, I love that Man from Galilee
He has done so very much for me
He forgave all my sins, put the love of God within
Oh I love that Man from Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night to learn the way of light
He asked the blessed Lord what he must do
But the Lord said unto him 'Ye must be born again'
By the Spirit of the Man of Galilee.

NEW CHORUS

Oh, I love that Man from Galilee
He has done so very much for me
He forgave all my sins, put the Holy Ghost within
Oh I love that Man from Galilee.

The lame were made to walk, the dumb were made to talk
When words were spoken, with power, in His name
The blind were made to see and, oh, it could only be
By the Spirit of the Man of Galilee.
