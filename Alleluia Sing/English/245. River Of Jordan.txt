All things work together for good when God's love is understood
God is good and everything He does is right
Springtime flowers wilt and fade but the memories that they make
Are a ray of sunshine in the darkest night.

CHORUS

There's a love that's calling from the other side
(love is calling from the other side)
As we stand and gaze across the great divide
(As we stand and gaze across the great divide)
God our Father loves us all, oh hear His loving call
(God loves us all, oh hear His loving call)
Love will bring us all together by and by (by and by).

Light comes shining out of the past, truth revealing love at last
There's a love that leads beyond the great divide
Joy and laughter, pain and tears, love is calling through the years
Love will bring us safely to the other side.

Long ago when life was young love already had begun
Memories of a time when roses were in bloom
Time so swiftly past us flies, autumn comes and summer dies
Love will bring us all together very soon.

Hear the music in the air, God is love and everywhere
Walk in love and you will join God's happy throne
Earthly things will lose their tune for they fade away so soon
Love will bring us all together with a song.
