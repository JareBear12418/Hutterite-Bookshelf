Kneel down by the side of your mother, my boy
You have only a moment I know
But stay till I give you my parting advice
It is all that I have to bestow.

CHORUS

Hold fast to the right, hold fast to the right
Wherever your footsteps may roam
Oh forsake not the way of salvation my boy
That you've learned from your mother at home.

I gave you to God in your cradle, my boy
And I taught you the best that I knew
But as long as His mercy permits me to live
I shall never cease praying for you.

We leave you to seek your employment, my boy
By this world you have yet to be tried
And whatever temptations and trials you have
May your heart in your Savior confide.

You shall find in your satchel a Bible, my boy
It's the book, of all others the best
It will help you to live and prepare you to die
It will lead to the gates of the blessed'
