As I journey through valleys of sorrow
Where the way seems so strange and unknown
:Lord You know I need a helping hand to borrow
For I can't find the way all alone:

I don't have here no other hand to guide me
I'm so small, I'm so weak and undone
:Come and walk a little closer Lord beside me
For I can't find the way all alone:

When the raging storms of life's filth have found me
Lord I pray wilt Thou keep me Thy own
:Let me feel Thy precious arms tight around me
For I can't find the way all alone:

Lord I can't find the way here without You
Oh dear Lord look upon me from Thy throne
:Make me worthy and let light shine around me
For I can't find the way all alone'
