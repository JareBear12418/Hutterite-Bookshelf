If I ask for things that I should not ask for
If I pray for things needlessly
If I ask for myself and not for my neighbor
Lift the scales from my eyes and let me see.

'Not my will, Thine be done,' prayed Jesus
May this same prayer be mine everyday
When this robe of flesh that I wear makes me falter
Guide my steps, hold my hand all the way.

If I walk by sight, and not by the Spirit
If I live each day just for me
If I care not how this poor world is dying
Cleanse my heart, blessed Lord, let me see.

Not my will, Thine be done, dear Jesus
With my whole heart I yield unto Thee
While my life shall last I will talk of Your goodness
Thank you Lord, by Thy grace I shall see.
