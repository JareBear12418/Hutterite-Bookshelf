Every time I do a deed I shouldn't do
Every time I say a word I shouldn't say
Let me tell you what I do
And this brings a blessing, too
I just steal away somewhere and pray.

CHORUS

I just steal away (steal away and pray)
I just steal away (steal away and pray)
And I ask my blessed Lord to lead the way
I just steal away (steal away and pray)
I just steal away (steal away and pray)
I just steal away somewhere and pray.

I know God will hear and answer all my prayers
If I thank Him for His blessings everyday
When I'm burdened down with grief
He will give my heart relief
When I steal away to Him and pray.
