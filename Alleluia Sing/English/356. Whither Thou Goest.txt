As you have joined your hands in one
Before our God above
May you as Ruth of old has done
Pledge now this vow of love.

CHORUS

Whither thou goest I will go
Whither thou lodgest I will lodge
Thy people shall my people be, thy God, my God
Thy people shall my people be, thy God, my God.

Though to a country near or far
You shall be called to go
You'll live together for the Lord
His blessings you will know.

In health or sickness, good or ill
Faithful you'll be and true
This is the vow today you've made
Now and for all life through.
