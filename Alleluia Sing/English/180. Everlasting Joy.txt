My troubles are so many, my pleasures are so few
My heart was always troubled with pain I never knew
But slowly I surrendered as Jesus took control
He put that everlasting joy down in my soul.

CHORUS

Now I have an everlasting joy within
Since when Jesus took away my sin
The moment that He loved me, He made me fully whole
He put that everlasting joy down in my soul.

I'm drinking from a fountain that's flowing from on high
The wells of living water that never will run dry
I'm feasting on God's manna and praying day by day
If that everlasting joy is here to stay.

I'm heading for a city, not one that's made by man
I'm crossing over Jordan to God's promised land
The waters will be parted and I'll be on my way
As I'm crossing over Jordan there to stay.
