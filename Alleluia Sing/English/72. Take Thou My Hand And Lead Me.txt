Take Thou my hand and lead me unto the end
In life and death I need Thee, oh blessed Friend
I cannot live without Thee for one brief day
Lord be Thou ever near me and lead the way.

Thou mighty God of ages, oh be Thou near
When angry tempest rages, I need not fear
Close by Thy side abiding, I fear no foe
While Thy strong hand is guiding, life hath no woe.

When evening shadows lengthen, the night is come
My faint heart, Father, strengthen and bring me home
Take Thou my hand and lead me unto the end
In life and death I need thee, oh blessed Friend.
