We are a moment, You are forever
Lord of the ages, God before time
We are a vapor, You are eternal
Love everlasting, reigning on high.

CHORUS

Holy, holy, Lord, God Almighty
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Highest praises honor and glory

Be unto Your name, be unto Your name.
We are the broken, You are the healer
Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save
You are the love song we'll sing forever
Bowing before You, blessing Your name.
