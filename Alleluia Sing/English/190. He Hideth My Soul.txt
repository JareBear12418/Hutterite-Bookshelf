A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord
A wonderful Savior to me
He hideth my soul in the clefts of the rock
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

CHORUS

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry thirsty land
He hideth my life in the depths of His love
And covers me there with His Hand
And covers me there with His Hand.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord
He taketh my burdens away
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved
He giveth me strength as my day.

With numberless blessings each moment He crowns
And filled with His fullness divine
I sing in my rapture, oh glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine.

When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love
I'll shout with the millions on high.
