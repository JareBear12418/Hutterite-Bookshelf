Seek ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness
And all these things shall be added unto you
Hallelu, Hallelujah.

Ask and it shall be given unto you
Seek and ye shall find
Knock and the door shall be opened unto you
Hallelu, Hallelujah.

Man cannot live by bread alone
But by every word
That proceeds from the mouth of God
Hallelu, Hallelujah.

Let your light so shine among men
That they may see your good works
And glorify your Father in heaven
Hallelu, Hallelujah.
