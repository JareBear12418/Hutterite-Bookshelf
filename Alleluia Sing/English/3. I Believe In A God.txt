[D]I believe in a God even though I can't [G]see Him
Even when He is [D]silent, I know He is [A]there
I[D] know if I wait on the Lord and will [G]listen
In a still, small [D]voice He [A]speaks to me [D]here.

CHORUS

I [G]believe in a God and I [D]know that I shall see Him
Someday in Heaven upon His great [A]throne
I [D]believe in a God and I know He is [G]with me
Will be with me [D]here till I [A]enter my [D]home.

I believe that the sun even when I can't see it
Is there when the clouds keep it hidden from view
I know it will shine once again in its splendor
When the clouds break away and let it shine through.

I believe in a love that is true and tender
For God in His love sent it down from above
I believe in a love even when I can't feel it
In this cold, empty world where few know His love.
