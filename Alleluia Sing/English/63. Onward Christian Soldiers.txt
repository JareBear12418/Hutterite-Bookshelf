Onward Christian soldiers, marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus going on before
Christ the Royal Master leads against the foe
Forward into battle, see His banners go.

CHORUS

Onward Christian soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.

Like a mighty army moves the Church of God
Brothers we are treading where the saints have trod
We are not divided, all one body we
One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane
But the Church of Jesus constant will remain
Gates of hell can never 'gainst the Church prevail
We have Christ's own promise, and that cannot fail.

Onward then ye people, join our happy throng
Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song
'Glory, praise and honor, unto Christ the King'
This through countless ages men and angels sing.
