CHORUS

I wanna rain and shine, both at the same time
A blessing and a beacon that You provide
To the fertile fields, the barren plains, Lord I'll go in Your name
Rain, cold or cloud, show me how to plant the seeds and pull the weeds
With the living water and the light divine I'll rain and shine.

Lord I want to be a blessing to a dry and thirsty soul
Pouring out Your love and letting forgiveness flow
Weary hearts will wither without refreshing water
Showers come from You and it's a vessel You can use.

This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine
Someone may be watching lost and alone tonight
One little candle can light the way; I'd love to be the flame
With Your love to keep my heart aglow, I can give a ray of hope.
