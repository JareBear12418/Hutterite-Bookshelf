You are the river of life, You are the joy of my soul
You are the raging river out of control
Riding the waves of Your glory, to depths of joy I've not known
Release a deeper flooding in my soul (in my soul),

CHORUS

Jesus, flow like a river
(And it's) deeper than the sea in me
Take me to the deepest ocean of Your heart and let me go
Plunge me deeper, let your living waters flow (waters flow),

Never a river so peaceful, never a river so pure
Never have I known cleansing, so deep and so sure
Never a river so peaceful, while raging out of control
But now I have found what satisfies my soul (in my soul),
