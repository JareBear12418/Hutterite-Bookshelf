When I look at You I realize the little that I know
When I look at You I realize how far I have to go
Oh, my mind cannot conceive the thought of why You'd love me so
When I'm so far from what You are, then I seem to move so slow.

CHORUS

You didn't have to love me
But You did, You didn't have to heal me
But You did, You didn't have to die on Calvary for me
But You did, but You did
You didn't have to save me
But You did, now send Your spirit to sway me
But You did, You didn't have to love me, save me, heal me
But You did.

When others look at me I hope they'll see reflections there of You
When others look at me I hope that they will want to know You too
For if they can't see Your love in me then I have failed in what I do
Though I'm so far from what You are, I'm becoming more like You.
