1. Thank-you for the valleys I walked through today;
The darker the valley, the more I learned to pray.
I found you where the lilies were blooming by the way,
And I thank you for the valleys I walked through today.

Chorus:
Thank-you for every hill I climb,
For every time the sun didn't shine.
Thank-you for every lonely night;
I prayed till I knew everything was all right;
And I thank you for the valleys I walked through today.

2. Life can't be all sunshine, or the flowers would die,
The rivers would be desert, all barren and dry.
Life can't be all a blessing, or there'd be no need to pray;
So, I thank you for the valleys I walked through today.

3. Sometimes there is a mountain that's very hard to climb,
But if I stay down on my knees, I climb it everytime,
You're always there to help me, you lead me by the hand,
O'er the mountains, through the valleys, into that promised land.

4. Thank-you for the strength, Lord, to thank you today;
I praise you, my shepherd, for guiding each day.
Through all of my struggles, you've drawn me close to you,
And I thank you, dear Jesus, for every valley you chose.
