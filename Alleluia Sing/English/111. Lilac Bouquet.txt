I just opened my Bible and it brought back old times
I could see Mother's teardrops on every line
And there on the pages a fragrance still lay
A faded blue ribbon and a lilac bouquet.

CHORUS

The orchids so tender and the lilies so fair
A blushing red rose that could never compare
It's the memories of Mother and I know that she'll say
'I thank you my child for the lilac bouquet.'

The birds are still singing around the old home
Back in the fields where I used to roam
Beneath the old tree there's an old lonesome grave
Where the angels came calling for Mother one day.

In the bright courts of heaven, in a beautiful home
I can see my dear mother around the great throne
In the Garden of Eden dear mother someday
I'll pick you another lilac bouquet.
