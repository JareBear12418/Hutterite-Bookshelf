I wandered aimlessly down sinful pathways
No hope in life could see, no peace within
But when He came to me with grace of hope and free
I never knew love till 1 met Him.

CHORUS

I never knew love till I met Jesus
I never knew love till I met Him
I never knew love or the meaning of happiness
I never knew love till I met Him.

In Him alone I stand, none else can help me
I'll trust the nail scarred hands to lead the way
He's given everything that I might shout and sing
I never knew love till I met Him.
