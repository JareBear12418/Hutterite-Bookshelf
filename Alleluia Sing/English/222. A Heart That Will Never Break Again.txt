I remember standing at my daddy's bedside
And the tears filled up the wrinkles in his face
As I held his withered hand he smiled and whispered
'Child, I'm going to live in a better place.'

CHORUS

And I'll have eyes that will never fill with teardrops
I'll have legs that will never ache with pain
I'll have hands that will never age or wither
And a heart that will never break again.

I have often heard and read about a city
Where with Jesus we shall live forever more
There are mansions in construction for my dwelling
And the streets of gold will run by my front door.

And all the eyes of the blind will then be opened
As they'll join the victory march of the lame
And the deaf, who's never heard the roar of thunder
Will rejoice to hear the Savior call his name.
