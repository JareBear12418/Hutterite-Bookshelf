High on the mountain, bruised by the storm
Growing unoticed by man
There grows a flower in this solid stone
Placed there by God's loving hand.

CHORUS

You may be a rock flower, my brother
While others a lily or a rose
There is purpose in blooming where planted
Growing where nothing else grows.

Be faithful and serve Him wherever He says
Even when blessings seem few
Though fragile and thirsty your spirit may be
Like a flower with no morning dew.

BRIDGE

They say lilies won't grow on a mountain
And roses won't bloom in the snow.
