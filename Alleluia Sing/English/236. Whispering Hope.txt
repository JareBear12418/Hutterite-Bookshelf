Soft as the voice of an angel
Breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers a comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over
Wait till the tempest is done
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow
After the shower is gone.

CHORUS

Whispering hope (whispering hope, whispering hope)
Oh how welcome Thy voice (welcome Thy voice, welcome Thy voice)
Making my heart (making my heart, making my heart)
In its sorrow rejoice.

If in the dusk of the twilight
Dim be the region afar
Will not the deepening darkness
Brighten the glimmering star
Then when the night is upon us
Why should the heart sink away
When the dark midnight is over
Watch for the breaking of day.

Hope as an anchor so steadfast
Rends the dark veil from the soul
Whither the Master has entered
Robbing the grave of its goal
Come then, oh come glad fruition
Come to my sad, weary heart
Come oh Thou blest hope of glory
Never, oh never depart.
