I will serve Thee because I love Thee
You have given life to me
I was nothing before You found me
You have given life to me.

CHORUS

Heartaches, broken pieces
Ruined lives are why You died on Calvary
Your touch was what I longed for
You have given life to me.

I will serve Thee because I love Thee
You have brought such peace to me
I was wandering, distraught and lonely
You have cleansed and set me free.

I will praise Thee, bow down before Thee
Walk in the light You give to me
My whole being I give to Thee, Lord
Let Your Spirit dwell in me.
