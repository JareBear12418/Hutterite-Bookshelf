Not long ago I was thinking of home
And I wondered if Mama was there all alone
I thought I'd drop by, as I'd done before
But the sound from within made me stop at the door.

She was praying, a sound that the worid seldom hears
Praying, her words were so pleading and clear
The sound of her voice as she spoke my name
Brought tears to my eyes, my heart filled with shame
Praying, praying for someone like me.

I was walking one night and I felt so alone
My heart was weary from the trouble I'd known
I hadn't noticed a church that was near
Till the sound from within seemed to fill the air.

They were praying, a sound that the world seldom hears
Praying, the children that God loves so dear
Outside in the darkness, I could not see
But I could picture them down on their knees
Praying, praying for someone like me.
