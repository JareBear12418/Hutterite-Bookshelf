I can't see your heart, I can't read your mind
There's no way for me to know the feelings that you hide
For me to see your love, you've got to let it show
Love isn't love, till you let it go.

Tell me what's the use just holding on
Someday you'll find what you thought you had is gone
You can't save your love like it's silver or gold
Love isn't love, till you let it go.

CHORUS

Love isn't love till you give it away
Like a never ending circle it comes back your way
Love in your heart wasn't put there to stay
Love isn't love till you give it away.

Just look at the cross if you're ever in doubt
You'll see the love He had for you poured out
A love so great no tomb could ever hold
Love isn't love, till you let it go.
