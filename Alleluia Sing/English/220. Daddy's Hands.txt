I remember Daddy's hands, folded silently in prayer
And reaching out to hold me, when I had a nightmare
You could read quite a story in the calluses and lines
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind.

I remember Daddy's hands, how they held my Mama tight
And patted my back for something done right
There are things that I've forgotten that I loved about the man
But I'll always remember the love in Daddy's hands.

CHORUS

Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was crying
Daddy's hands were hard as steel when I'd done wrong
Daddy's hands weren't always gentle, but I've come to understand
There was always love in Daddy's hands.

I remember Daddy's hands as they held the Bible near
Reading to the family; these times were so dear
With tears in his eyes he would ask us all to kneel
Things in life may change but memories never will.

I remember Daddy's hands working 'til they bled
Sacrificed unselfishly, just to keep us all fed
If I could do things over I'd live my life again
And never take for granted the love in Daddy's hands'
