Holy Spirit, faithful guide
Ever near the Christian's side
Gently lead us by the hand
Pilgrims in a desert land
Weary souls forever rejoice
While they hear the sweetest voice
Whisper softly 'Wand'rer come
Follow me, I'll guide you home.'

Ever preset, truest Friend
Ever near, Thine aid to lend
Leave us not to doubt and fear
Groping on in darkness drear
When the storms are raging sore
Hearts grow faint, and hopes give o'er
Whisper softly 'Wand'rer come
Follow me, I'll guide you home.'

When our days of toil shall cease
Waiting still for sweet release
Nothing left but heaven and prayer
Knowing that our names are there
Wading deep, the dismal flood
Pleading naught but Jesus' blood
Whisper softly 'Wand'rer come
Follow me, I'll guide you home.'
