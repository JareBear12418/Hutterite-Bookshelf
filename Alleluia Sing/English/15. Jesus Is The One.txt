When the day is dark before you
And the clouds are hanging low
There is One who watches o'er you
Everywhere that you may go.

CHORUS

Jesus is the One, yes He's the only One
Let Him have His way until the day is done
And when He speaks you know
The clouds will have to go
Just because He loves you so.

Oh, when you're sad and lonely
Life is but an empty tune
Breathe a prayer to Jesus only
He will drive away your gloom.

When you come to cross the river
He will be your friend and guide
You can live with Him forever
Over on the other side.
