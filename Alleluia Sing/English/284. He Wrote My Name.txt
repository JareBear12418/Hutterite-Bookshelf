The blessed Savior wrote my name when I was born again
He wrote it when He saved my soul
He wrote that I had made a-right my every sinful wrong
He wrote my name on heavens roll.

CHORUS

He wrote my name (my name) way up (way up) in glory (up in gloryland)
He saved my soul (Jesus saved my soul)
From sin and shame (safe from sin and shame)
I never shall (no, I never shall) forget the day (shall forget the day)
The blessed Savior wrote my name (He wrote my name).

I'll be no stranger when I reach my home in gloryland
My name is in the Book of Life
The blessed Savior wrote it when He saved my soul from sin
He saved my soul from sin and strife.

If I should live a thousand years upon this earth below
I never could forget the day
That Jesus wrote my name within the blessed Book of Life
He took my many sins away.
