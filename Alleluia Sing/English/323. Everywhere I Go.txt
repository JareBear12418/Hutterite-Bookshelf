CHORUS

Everywhere I go the Lord is always with me
Everywhere I go, He's right there by my side
He is constantly cheering me, pressing t'ward the victory
He is always leading me everywhere I go.

Here I am a climber, I'm climbing up the mountain
I'm searching for that city fair that I can call my home
Even though the hills are steep, even though the valleys deep
I've a friend who holds my hand so I'll not climb alone.

It's been a long hard journey when trudging through the darkness
My sights are set on heaven's door and I'll get there I know
Though I may be weary and the outlook may be dreary
The outlook points to victory and Jesus said it's so.
