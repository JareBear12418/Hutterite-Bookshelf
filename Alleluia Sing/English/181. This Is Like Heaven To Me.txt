We find many people who can't understand
Why we are so happy and free
We've crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair land
And this is like Heaven to me.

CHORUS

Oh, this is like Heaven to me
Yes, this is like Heaven to me
We've crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair land
And this is like Heaven to me.

So when we are happy we sing and we shout
Some don't understand us, you see
We're filled with the Spirit, there isn't a doubt
And this is like Heaven to me.

We're looking for Jesus with glory to come
'Tis Jesus who died on the tree
A cloud of bright angels to carry us home
Oh, that will be Heaven to me.

FINAL CHORUS

Oh, that will be Heaven to me
Yes, that will be Heaven to me
A cloud of bright angels to carry me home
Yes, that will be Heaven to me.
