God's given us years of happiness here
Now we must part
And as the angels come and call for you
The pains of grief tug at my heart.

CHORUS

Oh my darling, my darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journey.

Oh the days will be empty, the nights so long
Without you my love
And when God calls for you I'm left alone
But we will meet in heaven above.

Fond memories I'll keep of happy ways
That on earth we trod
And when I come we will walk hand in hand
As one in heaven in the family of God.
