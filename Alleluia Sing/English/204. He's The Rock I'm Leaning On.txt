If you don't care much about Him
And the things He's done for you
If His word you take for granted
And you don't believe it's true

If the blood He shed on Calvary
Won't melt your heart of stone
Please don't criticize Him
He's the rock I'm leaning on.

CHORUS

He's the rock of my salvation
He's my refuge from the storm
In sorrow He s my comfort
He's the reason I was born

He's the one I can depend on
When all my friends are gone
So please don't criticize Him
He's the rock I'm leaning on.

Friend, He could be your Savior
And He could be your dearest friend
When at your door He's knocking
If you'd only let Him in

He could be your strength and courage
When you feel like your alone
So please don't criticize Him
He's the rock I'm leaning on.
