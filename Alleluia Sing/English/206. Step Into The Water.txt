It's time we the people
Stand up for what is right
It's time we squared our shoulders back
And raised our swords to fight
For the Bible is our weapon
And the Spirit is our shield
And the Church needs more of its members
To be workers in the field.

CHORUS

Step into the water (step into the water)
Wade out a little bit deeper (wade out a little bit deeper)
Wet your feet in the water of His love
(Wet your feet in the water of His Love)
Step into the water (step into the water)
Wade out a little bit deeper (wade out a little bit deeper)
Come join angels singing praises to the Lamb of God.

There is victory for the Christian
Who walks the narrow way
There has been a prize appointed
For the soul who does not stray
Oh, I want to live for Jesus
And be all that I should be
So that I can rest with Him forever
Live eternally.
