Have you wandered along on life's pathway
Have you lived without love, a life of tears
Have you searched for that great hidden meaning
Or is your life filled with long, wasted years?

CHORUS

Wasted years, wasted years, oh how foolish
As you walked on in darkness and fear
Turn around, turn around, Christ is calling
He's calling you from a life of wasted years.

Search for wisdom and seek understanding
There is Someone who knows and always hears
Give it up, give it up, the load you're bearing
You can't go on in a life of wasted years.
