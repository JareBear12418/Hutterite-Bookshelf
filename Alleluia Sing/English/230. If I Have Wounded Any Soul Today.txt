If I have wounded any soul today
If I have caused one foot to go astray
If I have walked in my own willful way
Dear Lord, forgive.

If I have uttered idle words or vain
If I have turned aside from want or pain
Lest I myself shall suffer through the strain
Dear Lord, forgive.

If I have been perverse or hard or cold
If I have longed for shelter in Thy fold
When Thou hast given me some fort to hold
Dear Lord, forgive.

Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee
Forgive the secret sins I do not see
Oh guide me, love me, and my keeper be
Dear Lord, Amen. '
