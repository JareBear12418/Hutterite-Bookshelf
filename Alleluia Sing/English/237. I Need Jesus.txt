I thought I needed wealth, and I thought I needed fame
I could not be satisfied till someone knew my name
Thought I needed recognition and my name lifted high
But I found my greatest need was met when I knelt down one night.

CHORUS

I need Jesus, I need Jesus
In everything I do, I need Him
If you live near or far, doesn't matter who you are
If you're rich or you're poor, you need Him too.

When I knelt at the altar I prayed, 'Oh heavenly Father
Please come into my heart, calm my fears'
When I stood up I realized what I had found would be left behind
For the rest of my life I'll always need Him.
