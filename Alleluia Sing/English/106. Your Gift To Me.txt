Jesus, I pray that my life will be one
That reflects what You have in Your mind
Help me become more like Your own dear Son
More patient, more loving and kind.

CHORUS

Take from my spirit what isn't Your will
Make my love for You simple and true
I know that my life is Your gift to me
And Your gift I now give back to You.

Father, forgive me for going my way
There's no part of me that You don't know
But I come Heavenly Father to say, here I am
And to go where You want me to go.
