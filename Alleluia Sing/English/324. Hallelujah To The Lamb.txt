Traveling through this foreign land
Dust and shadows seem to blind us
Lightning flashes, thunder rolls
Frightening gales around us blow
When our cares of life are over
And the crown of life has been won
Up in Heaven we'll be singing
With the host the endless song (endless song).

CHORUS

Hallelujah to the Lamb (hallelujah to the Lamb)
Hallelujah to His name (hallelujah to His name)
We will shout and we will sing (we will shout and we will sing)
To our dear beloved King (to our dear beloved King)
Singing glory to His name (singing glory to His name)
To our mighty great I Am (to our mighty great I Am).

When the dark of night has gone
And we'll view eternal dawning
God himself will take us home
Where no teardrops will be known
Journey onward, ever onward
Take up courage, friend be strong
Up in Heaven we'll be singing
With the hosts the endless song (endless song)'
