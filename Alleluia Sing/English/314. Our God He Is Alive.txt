There is beyond the azure blue
A God concealed from human sight
He tinted skies with heavenly hue
And framed the worlds with His great might.

CHORUS

There is a God (there is a God)
He is alive (He is alive)
In Him we live (in Him we live)
And we survive (and we survive)
From dust our God (from dust our God)
Created man (created man)
He is our God (He is our God)
The great I AM (the great I AM).

There was a long, long time ago
A God whose voice the prophets heard
He is the God that we should know
Who speaks from His inspired Word.

Secure, is life from mortal mind
God holds the germ within His hand
Though men may search they cannot find
For God alone does understand.

Our God whose Son upon a tree
A life was willing there to give
That He from sin might set man free
And evermore with Him could live.
