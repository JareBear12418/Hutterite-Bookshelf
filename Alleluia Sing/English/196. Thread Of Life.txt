A little boy stood gazing into the clouds above
'I know my kite is still up there
For I can feel the tug'
A smile then crossed his little face
A tug had made it real
That's just the way the spirit works
Thank God for what I feel.

CHORUS

Thank God for what I feel inside
I know my God is real
I can feel His touch from Heaven above
My hungry soul He feeds
God gave His only Son to die
A ransom, oh what love
I know God holds the thread of life
For I can feel the tug.

When life down here has finished
And I cross the great divide
I'm free from all sorrow
When I've reached the other side
My treasures are up yonder
In a land of perfect love
I know God holds the thread of life
For I can feel the tug.
