Without Thee Lord I walk an empty pathway
Without Thee Lord my eyes are dimmed with tears
I'm as a sheepfold without a guiding shepherd
Just as a baby without a mother near.

CHORUS

Without Thee Lord my life would be as nothing
Without Thee Lord I'm as an empty sea
I'm as a sailor without a guiding compass
Just as a songbird without a melody.

Without Thee Lord my heart is sad and lonely
Without Thee Lord the bells of love can't ring
I'm as a morning without refreshing dewdrops
Just as a fountain without a flowing stream.

Without Thee Lord my nights are long and silent
Without Thee Lord the heavens seem so far
I'm as a candle without a glowing flame
Just as a twilight without an evening star.
