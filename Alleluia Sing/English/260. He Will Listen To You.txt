When the weight of the world crashes down on you
God will listen to you
When the sky turns black and your thoughts turn blue
He will listen you.

CHORUS

He will listen to you
Always listen to you
He understands how His children feel
He will listen to you.

When your river of tears cannot be contained
God will listen to you
Like a drowning man in the pouring rain
He will listen to you.

When the light explodes in a world gone wrong
God will listen to you
When your heart beats strong with a grateful song
He will listen to you.
