Praise the Lord there is mercy in Heaven
In that land where the sun never sets
For our Savior forgives not as mortals
But our Savior forgives and forgets.

CHORUS

He forgives (He forgives) and forgets (and forgets)
He forgives (He forgives) and forgets (and forgets)
Not as mortals forgive one another
But our Savior forgives and forgets.

When we bowed at the footstool of mercy
When we knocked on the door to get in
Jesus not only freely did pardon
He forgave and forgot every sin.

Oft we hear people say 'I forgive you
But I could not forget if I tried'
But our Savior's own blood sealed the ransom
To forgive and forget, He had died.

When the book shall be opened for judgment
May we find there no record of debt
We'll not fear if our sins have been pardoned
For our Savior forgives and forgets.
