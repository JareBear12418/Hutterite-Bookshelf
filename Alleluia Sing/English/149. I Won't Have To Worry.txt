Down here the burden's heavy
And the road is rough and long
Sometimes my feet get weary and so sore
But a brighter day is coming
Soon I'll step on Heaven's shore
And I won't have to worry anymore.

CHORUS

I won't have to worry when I reach the other shore
All my troubles will be over, and I'll rest forever more
My eyes will be on Jesus, and my heart will be aglow
And I won't have to worry anymore.

Someday when life is over
And I've said my last goodbye
I will see my Savior standing at the door
And I'll hear Him say 'You're welcome
All your cares are left behind'
And I won't have to worry anymore.
