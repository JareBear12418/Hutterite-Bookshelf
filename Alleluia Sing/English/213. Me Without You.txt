Like the grass lying still 'neath the flowers on a hill
Without You Lord, they just wouldn't grow
Like a lost sheep astray, I'd be wandering each day
Without You, I'd have no place to go.

CHORUS

I can vision a tree with no branches
I can vision a church with no pews
I can vision a well with no water
But Lord I can't picture me without You.

Precious Lord, be my guide, ever walking by my side
When I'm weak give me strength to go on
In the darkest of night, hold my hand, be my light
Guide my steps till I'm safely at home.
