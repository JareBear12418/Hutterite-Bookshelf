Come ye sinners, lost and lonely
Jesus' blood can set you free
For He saved the worst among you
When He saved a wretch like me.

CHORUS

And I know, yes I know
Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean
And I know, yes I know
Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner clean.

To the faint He giveth power
Through the mountains makes a way
Findeth water in the desert
Turns the night to golden day.

In temptation He is near thee
Holds the powers of hell at bay
Guides you to the path of safety
Gives you grace for everyday.

He will keep thee while the ages
Roll throughout eternity
Though earth hinders and hell rages
All must work for good to thee.
