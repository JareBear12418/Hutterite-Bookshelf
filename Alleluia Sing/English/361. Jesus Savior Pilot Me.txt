Jesus, Savior, pilot me
Over life's tempestuous sea
Unknown waves before me roll
Hiding rock and treacherous shoal
Chart and compass come from Thee
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

As a mother stills her child
Thou canst hush the ocean wild
Boisterous waves obey Thy will
When Thou sayest to them 'Be still'
Wondrous Sovereign of the sea
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

When at last I near the shore
And the fearful breakers roar
Twixt me and the peaceful rest
Then, while leaning on Thy breast
May I hear Thee say to me,
'Fear not, I will pilot thee.'
