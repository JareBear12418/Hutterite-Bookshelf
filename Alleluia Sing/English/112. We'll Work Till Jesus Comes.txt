Oh land of rest for thee I sigh
When will the moment come
When I shall lay my armor by
And dwell in peace at home?

CHORUS

We'll work (we'll work) till Jesus comes
We'll work (we'll work) till Jesus comes
We'll work (we'll work) till Jesus comes
And we'll be gathered home.

No tranquil joys on earth I know
No peaceful shelt'ring dome
This world's a wilderness of woe
This world is not my home.

To Jesus Christ I fled for rest
He bade me cease to roam
And lean for succor on His breast
Till He conduct me home.

I sought at once my Savior's side
No more my steps shall roam
With Him I'll brave death's chilling tide
And reach my heavenly home'
