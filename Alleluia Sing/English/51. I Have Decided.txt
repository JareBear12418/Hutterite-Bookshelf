I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back.

If no one joins me, still I will follow
If no one joins me, still I will follow
If no one joins me, still I will follow
No turning back, no turning back.

The cross before me, the world behind me
The cross before me, the world behind me
The cross before me, the world behind me
No turning back, no turning back.
