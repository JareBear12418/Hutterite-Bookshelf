He paid a debt He did not owe
lowed a debt I could not pay
I needed someone to wash my sins away
And now I sing a brand new song, 'Amazing Grace'
Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay.

My debt He paid upon the cross
He cleansed my soul from all its dross
I thought that no one could all my sins erase
But now I sing a brand new song, 'Amazing Grace'
Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay.

Oh such great pain my Lord endured
When He my sinful soul secured
I should have died there but Jesus took my place
So now I sing a brand new song, 'Amazing Grace'
Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay.

He didn't give to me a loan
He gave Himself, now He's my own
He's gone to Heaven to make for me a place
So now i sing a brand new song, 'Amazing Grace'
Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay.
