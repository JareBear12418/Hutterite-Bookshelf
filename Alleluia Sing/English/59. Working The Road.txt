I often think of the day so swiftly passing away
The road to Heaven seems hard to find
But I am doing my best to reach that home of the blessed
And make it easier for those behind.

CHORUS

Oh yes I working the road (to glory), working the road (to glory)
Helping the weak and blind
I want to smooth out the road that leads to heaven above
And make it easier for those behind.

The road to heaven is straight and oh so narrow
The gate around with trials on every side
So we must clean out the chaff that hinders many a prayer
And make it easier for those behind.

I'm trying daily to live for others
Something to give my brothers groping in darkness blind
I want to hear them someday in glory lovingly say
You've made it easier for those behind.
