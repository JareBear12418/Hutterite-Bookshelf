CHORUS

You are the words and the music
You are the song that I sing
You are the melody, You are the harmony
Praise to Your name I will bring
You are the Lord of lords
You are the mighty God
You are the King of all kings
So now I give back to You
The song that You gave to me
You are the song that I sing.

Spreading Your truth unto every land
Building Your kingdom with hearts and hands
The whole world resounds with Your praise
Humbly we bow down to worship You
Bending we lift up our eyes to You
The rocks cry out, praising Your name.

Living together in unity
Joining our voices in harmony
The melody flows from our praise
All that we are and we'll ever know
All that we have is a gift from You
All glory and honor is Yours'
