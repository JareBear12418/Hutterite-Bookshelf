CHORUS

It's like watching the sunshine for the first time
As the rainbow shows its colors through the rain
And the clover in the fields now look much greener
And I know my life will never be the same.

I never thought that I could sing a song
That would make the tears of joy roll down my face
All the burdens I had carried for so long
Jesus came, and now my past has been erased.

I wandered in a world I could not share
And from the clutches of its chilly hands
Into a life of joy beyond compare
And I never knew that life could be so grand.
