There's a comforting thought at the close of the day
When I'm discouraged, weary and confused
That feeling takes hold of my searching soul
And it tells me I'm so richly blessed
To have You here, knowing You care
Enough to tell me when I'm wrong again
You always remind me we dare not give up the fight
I'm so glad I touched shoulders with You.

CHORUS

Did You know You were strong
Did You know You were my rock
Did You know I was leaning on You
Did You know I grow stronger and wiser because
I have always touched shoulders with You.

I can fly higher than an eagle soaring through the sky
When You guide me through the storms of life
You're the wind beneath my wings sustaining me always
I can count on You, You are ever true
I could not go on without Your love and care
It fills my heart and soul, it leaves me aright
You always remind me, we dare not give up the fight
I'm so glad I touched shoulders with You.
