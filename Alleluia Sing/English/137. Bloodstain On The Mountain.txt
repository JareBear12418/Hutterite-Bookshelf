There were angels gathered 'round the hillside many years ago
Just waiting for the Prince of Peace to die
They bowed their heads while lightning flashed
The mighty thunder roared
That dreadful day when heaven's angels cried.

CHORUS

There's a bloodstain on the mountain
Where His blood came dripping down
There's a tearstain in the garden
Where He knelt upon the ground
There was judgment on the soldier
That pierced Him in the side
Yes, the Master went to Calvary
To hide your sins and mine.

The angels took a picture of what their eyes had seen
And journeyed toward the distant milky way
They wept and cried while the picture flashed
On heaven's golden screen
As they recalled the price He had to pay.
