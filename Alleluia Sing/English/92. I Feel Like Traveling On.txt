My heavenly home is bright and fair
I feel like traveling on
No pain nor death can enter there
I feel like traveling on.

CHORUS

Yes, I feel like traveling, traveling on
I feel like traveling on
My heavenly home is bright and fair
I feel like traveling on.

Its glittering towers the sun outshines
I feel like traveling on
That heavenly mansion shall be mine
I feel like traveling on.

Let others seek a home below
I feel like traveling on
Which flames devour, or waves o'erflow
I feel like traveling on.

The Lord has been so good to me
I feel like traveling on
Until the blessed home I see
I feel like traveling on. '
