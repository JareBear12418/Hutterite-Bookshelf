When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound
And time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved on earth shall gather
Over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there.

CHORUS

When the roll is called up yonder (when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder (when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder (when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there.

On that bright and cloudless morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of His resurrection share
When His chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the sky
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there.

Let us labor for our Master
From the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care
Then when all of life is over
And our work on earth is done
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there.
