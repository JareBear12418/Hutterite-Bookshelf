Oh soul, do you know the present and the past
All that you have been through
Yet lies before you 'future' deep and vast
God only knows what it will hold for you.

CHORUS

Trust your hand into His
Give your all unto Him
Let Him lead you all the way
Trust your hand into His.

Maybe some joy or sorrow 'round the bend
Lies there to wrap your soul
Or just a chance a helping hand to lend
Some weary wanderer to find the goal.

Oh, will you trust your future unto Him
Who led the men of old
To lead you too, through valleys that are dim
And tread each step as He to you'll unfold.

Then when at last you're led up the last climb
And break all earthly ties
And God Himself will welcome you sublime
Forever more beneath celestial skies.
