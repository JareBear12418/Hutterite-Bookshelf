My boat of life sails on a troubled sea
Whenever there's a wind in my sail
But I have a Friend who watches over me
When the breeze turns into a gale.

CHORUS

I know the Master of the wind
I know the Maker of the rain
He can calm the storm and make the sun shine again
I know the Master of the wind.

Sometimes I soar like an eagle to the sky
Among the peaks my soul can be found
An unexpected storm may drive me from the heights
Brings me lower but never brings me down.
