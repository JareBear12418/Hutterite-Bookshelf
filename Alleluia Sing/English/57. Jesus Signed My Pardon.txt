I was in sin's prison, oh so dark and cold
Just a lost sheep wandering from God's eternal fold
Then the door swung open, Jesus said to me
'I have signed your pardon, now you may go free.'

CHORUS

Jesus signed my pardon, this I surely know
Took my place on Calvary, now I don't have to go
All my life I gave Him, He gave His for me
When He signed my pardon there on Calvary.

Since the Savior led me from that awful place
I can hear the angels sing, they sing 'Amazing Grace'
I know I was pardoned from my awful sin
Now I'll join in singing 'Glory to His Name.'

Life is now worth living, since He set me free
I know He was willing to save a wretch like me
Now I own a mansion, not a prison wall
For He signed my pardon, yes, He paid it all.
