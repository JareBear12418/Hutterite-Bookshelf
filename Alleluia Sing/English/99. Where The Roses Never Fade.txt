I am going to a city
Where the streets with gold are laid
Where the tree of life is blooming
And the roses never fade.

CHORUS

Here they bloom but for a season
Soon their beauty is decayed
I am going to a city
Where the roses never fade.

In this world we have our troubles
Satan's snares we must evade
We'll be free from all temptation
Where the roses never fade.

Loved ones gone to be with Jesus
In their robes of white arrayed
Now are waiting for my coming
Where the roses never fade.
