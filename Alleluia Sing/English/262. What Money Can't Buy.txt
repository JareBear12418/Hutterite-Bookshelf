Watch the rain fall over the fields in the valley
Hear the thunder roll across the sky
See the sunrays shine through a wall without windows
We hold and smile at what money can't buy.

CHORUS

We have a mansion seen only by me and you
Our days without sunshine are few
We've always loved even those who made us cry
We hold hands and smile at what money can't buy.

Our children are playing, no shoes on their feet
And patch after patch on their knees
Yet we hear only laughter and people ask why
We hold hands and smile at what money can't buy. '
