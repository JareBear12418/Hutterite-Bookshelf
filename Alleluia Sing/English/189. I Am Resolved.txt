I am resolved no longer to linger
Charmed by the world's delight
Things that are higher, things that are nobler
These have allured my sight.

CHORUS

I will (I will hasten) hasten to him
Hasten so glad and free (hasten so glad and free)
Jesus, greatest, highest
I will come to Thee.

I am resolved to go to the Savior
Leaving my sin and strife
He is the true One, He is the just One
He hath the words of life.

I am resolved to follow the Savior
Faithful and true each day
Heed what He sayeth, do what He willeth
He is the living way.
