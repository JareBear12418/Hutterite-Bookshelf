Wounded soldier, pick up your weapon
Let's fight the battle, we're not alone
For the angels are camped around us
We're not defeated, we'll soon be home.

When we're weakened by Satan's army
And it seems like the battle will be lost
We must keep marching and remember
That we are soldiers of the cross.

CHORUS

Wounded soldier (wounded soldier)
Pick up your weapon (pick up your weapon)
Let's fight the battle (let's fight the battle)
We're not alone (we're not alone)

For the angels (for the angels)
Are camped around us (are camped around us)
We're not defeated (we're not defeated)
We'll soon be home (we'll soon be home).

In times of darkness we'll stand together
The weapon of prayer will make us strong
Don't be discouraged, just trust in Jesus
And soon we'll be singing victory's song.
