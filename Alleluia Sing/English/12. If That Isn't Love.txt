He left the splendors of Heaven
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely hill of Golgotha
There He lay down His life for me.

CHORUS

If that isn't love, the ocean is dry
There's no stars in the sky and the sparrow can't fly
If that isn't love, then heaven's a myth
There's no feeling like this, if that isn't love.

Even in death He remembered
The thief hanging by His side
He spoke with love and compassion
Then He took him to Paradise.
