I've been scorned by a neighbor whom I treasured
I've been deceived by a friend I held dear
So many times I just wanted to give up
Then I remembered my Lord is right here.

CHORUS

Another hill and sometimes a mountain
Another road with rocks to hurt my feet
But when He walks along beside me
I can make it, there'll be no retreat.

I made plans for myself and for others
Something I wanted so to do tomorrow
Disappointment turned out to be the harvest
Leaving me with a little more sorrow.

I have questioned the loss of a loved one
I wondered why it happened to me
But through prayers I found the answers
It was all quite plain to me.
