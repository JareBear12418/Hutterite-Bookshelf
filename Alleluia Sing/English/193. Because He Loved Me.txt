On a hill called Calvary, Jesus my lord suffered for me
Carried the cross on that day my sins to atone
Then they nailed Him to the cross
Great was the pain and the cost
He suffered it all (He suffered it all)
Because He loved me (because He loved me).

CHORUS

Because He loved me, my Savior died
On the cross was crucified
No greater love by mortal man has ever been known
Oh praise His dear name, I love Him so
I am His, He's mine I know
He suffered it all (He suffered it all)
Because He loved me (Because He loved me).

Then they carried Him away, placed Him in a lonely grave
Surely they thought that this would be the end of this Man
But on that third and glorious day
God came and rolled the stone away
He rose from the dead (He rose from the dead)
Because He loved me (because He loved me).
