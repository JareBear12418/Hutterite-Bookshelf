Jesus has a table spread
Where the saints of God are fed
He invites His chosen people, come and dine
With His manna He doth feed
And supplies our every need
Oh 'tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the time.

CHORUS

Come and dine, the Master calleth, come and dine
You may feast at Jesus' table all the time
He who fed the multitude, turned the water into wine
To the hungry calleth now, come and dine.

The disciples came to land
Thus obeying Christ's command
For the Master called unto them, come and dine
There they found their hearts' desire
Bread and fish upon the fire
Thus He satisfies the hungry every time.

Soon the Lamb will take His bride
To be ever at His side
All the host of Heaven will assembled be
Oh 'twill be a glorious sight
All the saints in spotless white
And with Jesus they will feast eternally'
