CHORUS

They're holding up the ladder that I'm climbing on
I'm climbing up the ladder and I'm going home
At the top of the ladder, oh what joy there shall be
As the angels are holding up this ladder for me.

As I climb this gospel ladder always heeding every sign
I know my Savior's with me and He's teaching me to climb
Every day that I'm climbing there's a battle for me
Every step on the ladder is another victory.

There's a mansion being built for me somewhere in gloryland
And this ladder that I'm climbing is a part of the plan
I can hear the angels beckoning to keep climbing, don't stop
There's a crown of life awaiting when you reach the very top.

Come on you Christian soldiers, show the world your light can shine
Get on His gospel ladder and don't be afraid to climb
Can't you hear the angels cheering soon the battle will be o'er
And we'll celebrate the victory when we reach the other shore.
