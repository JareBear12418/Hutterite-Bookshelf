CHORUS

Guide me Lord through the day
Guide me Lord this I pray
Through all hardship, temptation and strife
Guide me Lord through the night
Guide me Lord by Thy might
That Thy will might be done in my life.

I would like to pay the loss
But since Jesus paid the cost
He pardoned me from all my iniquity
So till I'll see His face
I'll daily ask His grace
To guide me on the path He plans for my life.

God loves us, everyone
And He gave His only Son
To save our soul from sin and shame He gladly died
Now Jesus is the way
So trust in Him today
Then He'll lead you and be your daily guide.
