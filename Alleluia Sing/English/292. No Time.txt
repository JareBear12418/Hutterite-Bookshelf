I knelt to pray, but not for long
I had too much to do
Must hurry off and get to work
For bills would soon be due.

And so I said a hurried prayer
Jumped up from off my knees
My Christian duty now was done
My soul would be at ease.

All through the day I had no time
To speak a word of cheer
No time to speak of Christ to friends
They'd laugh at me, I feared.

No time, no time, too much to do
That was my constant cry
No time to give to those in need
At last 'twas time to die.

And when before the Lord I came
I stood with downcast eyes
Within His hands He held a book
It was the Book of Life.

God looked into His book and said
Your name I cannot find
I once was going to write it down
But never found the time.
