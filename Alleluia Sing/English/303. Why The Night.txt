It's really dark and cold tonight
And I'm so tired and all alone
I see no ray of hope inside
Oh Lord, why did You ever make night?

CHORUS

I made the night so you would trust in Me
I made the night so you would place your hand in Mine
I made the night so in the early morning
You could see My sun rise and shine.

Lord the pain is oh so hard to bear
And the path ahead looks grim
And through the tears I hear You say
'Oh child, I'll hold you through the night.'

Now as I place my trust in You
I can see the first rays of dawn
And I know that You are with me
Oh Lord, I'm so glad You made the night.
