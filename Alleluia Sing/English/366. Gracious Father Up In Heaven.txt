~ MELODY: THE ROSE

Gracious Father up in Heaven
Bless the love we've pledged to share
Ever lead our faltering footsteps
Guide and tend us everywhere

For we know, dear Lord, without Thee
We would surely lose the way
Therefore, Father, be Thou near us
Keep us each and every day.

May Your love shine down upon us
May Thy peace attend our way
Let us not forget to thank You
For the joys You send each day

But should come some grief and sadness
Disappointment, pain and tears
May our faith in Thee grow stronger
Knowing Thou art ever near.

Help us live for good of others
Ever leading souls to You
Ever lead us in green pastures
And beside the winding stream

Ever following Thy footsteps
Ever walking in Thy way
Till at last in heaven we praise Thee
This our prayer, dear Lord, Amen.
