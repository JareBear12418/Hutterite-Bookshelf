As a child my mama taught me about a Man who lived for me
She said His name was Jesus and He died to set men free
She said there were some cruel ones who nailed His hands and feet
To a wooded cross on a hill known as Calvary.

With my eyes opened wide I listened to the things my mom described
A crown of thorns upon His head and a spear that pierced His side
When she finished off her story I looked into her eyes
And with lots of confusion, sadly I asked 'Mom did He ever cry?'

CHORUS

Through the eyes of a child things are simple
God has given them a vision we all need
Through the eyes of a child the world seems brighter
And there wouldn't be such cruelty
If we could see through the eyes of a child.

Since I have grown in spirit I think of how life used to be
When as a child I thought this world was everything it seemed
But with all the world's confusion the only thing I can believe
With the scars in His hands binding me, like a child my eyes can see.
