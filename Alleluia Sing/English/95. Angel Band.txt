My latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph is begun.

CHORUS

Oh come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home.

I know I'm nearing holy ranks
Of friends and kindred dear
I brush the dew of Jordan's banks
The crossing must be near.

I've almost gained my heavenly home
My spirit loudly sings
The holy ones behold they come
I hear the noise of wings.

Oh bear my longing heart to Him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory.
