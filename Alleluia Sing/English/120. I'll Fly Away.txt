Some glad morning when this life is o'er
I'll (flyaway) flyaway (flyaway)
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll (flyaway) flyaway (flyaway).

CHORUS

I'll (flyaway) flyaway, oh glory
I'll (flyaway) flyaway (in the morning)
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll (flyaway) flyaway (flyaway).

When the shadows of this life have grown
I'll (flyaway) flyaway (flyaway)
Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll (flyaway) flyaway (flyaway).

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll (flyaway) flyaway (flyaway)
To a land where joys shall never end
I'll (flyaway) flyaway (flyaway).
