There's a fountain free 'tis for you and me
Let us haste, oh haste to the brink
'Tis a fount of love from the Source above
And He bids us all freely drink.

CHORUS

Will you come to the fountain free
Will you come, 'tis for you and me
Thirsty soul hear the welcome call
There's a fountain open for all.

There's a living stream with a crystal gleam
From the throne of life now it flows
While the waters roll let the weary soul
Hear the call that forth freely goes.

There's a living well and its waters swell
And eternal life they can give
And we joyful sing, ever spring, oh spring
As we haste to drink and to live.

There's a rock that's cleft and no soul is left
That may not its pure waters share
'Tis for you and me and its stream I see
Let us hasten joyfully there.
