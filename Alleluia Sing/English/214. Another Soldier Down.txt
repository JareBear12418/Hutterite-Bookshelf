We're in a mighty conflict here
The army of the Lord
We must join forces, standing tall
And lean upon His word
The enemy is now in view
And bravely circles 'round
Then comes a cry from the battlefield
'Another soldier down.'

CHORUS

Go then with haste, stand by his side
And lend your strength once more
Oh bear him up with faith and prayer
Until the battle's o'er
The fight before the victory
The cross before the crown
Be ever watchful 'ere the cry
'Another soldier down.'

We've set our minds on victory
Advancing day by day
With God our hope, our strategy
Our fortress on the way
And at the end there is a rest
An everlasting crown
All end of fear, no more we'll hear
'Another soldier down.'
