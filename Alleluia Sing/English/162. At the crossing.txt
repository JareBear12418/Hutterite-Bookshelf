There's a river somewhere that's called Jordan
And they say that it's deep and it's wide
And they say that the king and the beggar
On the shore will stand side by side.

CHORUS

At the crossing (at the crossing) of the Jordan (of the Jordan)
Why should I be afraid
There'll be someone there who loves me to guide me (to guide me)
Across the river (across the river) to endless joys above.

Though the river is dark and stormy
It will pass like a dream in the night
And my soul will awake in the morning
To the regions of endless delight.
