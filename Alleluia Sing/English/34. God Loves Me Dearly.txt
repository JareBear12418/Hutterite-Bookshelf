God loves me dearly, grants me salvation
God loves me dearly, loves even me
Therefore I'll sing again, God loves me dearly
God loves me dearly, loves even me.

I was in bondage, sin, death and darkness
God's love was working to make me free
Therefore I'll sing again, God loves me dearly
God loves me dearly, loves even me.

He sent forth Jesus that true Redeemer
He sent forth Jesus and set me free
Therefore I'll sing again, God loves me dearly
God loves me dearly, loves even me.

Jesus my Savior Himself did offer
Jesus my Savior paid all I owed
Therefore I'll sing again, God loves me dearly
God loves me dearly, loves even me.

Now will I praise Thee, oh Love Eternal
Now will I praise Thee all my life long
Therefore I'll sing again, God loves me dearly
God loves me dearly, loves even me.
