CHORUS

When the sun comes up tomorrow, Lord, I'll be praising You
I'll always give You glory in everything I do
Although the storm clouds gather, or should the clouds be blue
When the sun comes up tomorrow, Lord, I'll be praising You.

You took my sins to Calvary, and died that I might live
I know that I'm not worthy of the blessings that You give
I know that You still love me and Lord I love You too
When the sun comes up tomorrow, Lord, I'll be praising You.

It may be on the mountain, or in the valley low
I may be free from heartaches or burdened as i go
Until my journey's ended and my life on earth is through
When the sun comes up tomorrow, Lord, I'll be praising You.
