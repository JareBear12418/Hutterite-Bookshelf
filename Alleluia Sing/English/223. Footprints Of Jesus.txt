Sweetly Lord have we heard Thee calling
'Come follow Me'
And we see where Thy footprints falling
Lead us to Thee.

CHORUS

Footprints of Jesus
That make the pathway glow
We will follow the steps of Jesus
Where'er they go.

Though they lead o'er the cold, dark mountains
Seeking His sheep
Or along by Siloam's fountains
Helping the weak.

If they lead through the temple holy
Preaching the Word
Or in homes of the poor and lowly
Serving the Lord.

Then, at last, when on high He sees us
Our journey done
We will rest where the steps of Jesus
End at His throne.
