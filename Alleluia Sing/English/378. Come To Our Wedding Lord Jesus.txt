~ MELODY: CHURCH IN THE WILDWOOD

Thank You, Lord, for our friends and our family
Who came on this beautiful day
Jesus, now we invite You to join us
And we trust You'll be with us to stay.

CHORUS

Oh, come, come, come, come
Come to our wedding, Lord Jesus
Oh come to our home now to stay
Be our guide, blessed Lord, as we travel
As we journey as one on life's way.

Now we know that a home's not completed
With only two hearts dwelling there
So we pray come and live in our home now
As together our lives we will share.

Should some trials and problems confront us
Oh, help us remember You're near
Keep us from saying things to each other
That we never would want You to hear.
