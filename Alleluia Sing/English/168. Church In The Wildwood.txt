There's a church in the valley by the wildwood
No lovelier spot in the dale
No place is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.

CHORUS

Oh come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh come to the church in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.

How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning
To listen to the clear ringing bell
Its tones so sweetly are calling
Oh come to the church in the vale.

Oh come to the church in the wildwood
To the trees where the wild flowers bloom
Where the parting hymn we'll be singing
We will rest by the side of the tomb.

From the church in the valley by the wildwood
When day fades away into night
I would fain from this spot of my childhood
Flyaway to the mansions on high'
