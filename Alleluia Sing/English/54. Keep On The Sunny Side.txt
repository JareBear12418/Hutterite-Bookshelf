There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
Thought we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view.

CHORUS

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we keep on the sunny side of life.

Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always
Who keepeth everyone in His care.

Though the storm in its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherished so dear
Storm and clouds will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear.
