Jesus, keep me near the cross
There a precious fountain
Free to all a healing stream
Flows from Calvary's mountain.

CHORUS

In the cross, in the cross
Be my glory ever
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross a trembling soul
Love and mercy found me
There the bright and morning star
Shed His beams around me.

Near the cross O Lamb of God
Bring its scenes before me
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadows o'er me.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait
Hoping, trusting ever
Till I reach the golden strand
Just beyond the river.
