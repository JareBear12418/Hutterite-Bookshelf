We praise Thee, oh God, for the Son of Thy love
For Jesus who died and is now gone above
Hallelujah, Thine the glory, hallelujah, amen
Hallelujah, Thine the glory, revive us again.

We praise Thee, oh God, for Thy spirit of light
Who has shown us our Savior and scattered our night
Hallelujah, Thine the glory, hallelujah, amen
Hallelujah, Thine the glory, revive us again.

All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain
Who has borne all our sins, and has cleansed every stain
Hallelujah, Thine the glory, hallelujah, amen
Hallelujah, Thine the glory, revive us again.

Revive us again, fill each heart with Thy love
May each soul be rekindled with fire from above
Hallelujah, Thine the glory, hallelujah, amen
Hallelujah, Thine the glory, revive us again.
