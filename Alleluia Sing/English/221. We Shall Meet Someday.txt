How our hearts ache with grief as we say goodbye
We shall meet (shall meet) someday
In the city of rest on the other side
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.

CHORUS

We shall meet (shall meet) where no storm clouds gather
We shall meet (shall meet) someday
By the river of life, sparkling cool and clear
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.

When we've all crossed the stream with its rolling tide
We shall meet (shall meet) someday
Where no sorrow or tears shall ever dim the eye
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.

What a glorious thought, as we say goodbye
We shall meet (shall meet) someday
In that beautiful home that's prepared on high
We shall meet (shall meet) someday.
