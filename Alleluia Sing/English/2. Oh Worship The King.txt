[G]Oh, worship the King all [C]glorious [D]above
O [G]gratefully sing His [C]wonderful [G]love
Our [D]Shield and Defender, the Ancient of days
Pavi[G]lioned in splendor, and [D]girded with [G]praise.

Oh, tell of His might and sing of His grace
Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form
And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light
It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain
And sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.

Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail
In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail
Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer and Friend.
