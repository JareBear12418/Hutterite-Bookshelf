~ MELODY: BE STILL MY SOUL

[D]I then shall [G]live as [A]one who's [G]been for[D]given
I'll walk with [G]joy to [A]know my [G]debts are [D]paid
I know my [G]name is [Bm]clear be[A]fore my Fa[G]ther
I am His [D]child, and I [A]am not a[D]fraid
So greatly [G]pardoned, I'll for[A]give anoth[G]er
The law of [D]love I glad[A]ly will [D]obey.

CHORUS

[D]I then shall [G]live as [A]one who's [G]learned compas[D]sion
I've been so [G]loved that [A]I'll risk [G]loving, [D]too
I know how [G]fear [Bm]builds walls in[A]stead of bridg[G]es
I dare to [D]see another's [A]point of [D]view
And when re[G]lation[Bm]ships de[A]mand commit[G]ment
Then I'll be [D]there to care [A]and follow [D]through.

Your kingdom come, around and through and in me
Your power and glory, let them shine through me
Your hallowed Name oh may I bear with honor
And may Your living Kingdom come in me
The Bread of Life, oh may I share with honor
And may You feed a hungry world through me.
