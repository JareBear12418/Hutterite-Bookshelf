CHORUS

Then palms of victory
Crowns of glory
Palms of victory I shall wear.

I saw a way-worn traveler in tatterted garments clad
He struggled up the mountain, it seemed that he was sad
His back was heavy-laden, his strength was almost gone
He shouted as he journeyed, 'Deliverance will come!'

The psalmster in the arbor, that stood beside the way
Attracted his attention, intending his delay
The watchwords being 'Onward!', he stopped his ears and ran
Still shouting as he journeyed, 'Deliverance will come!'

The summer sun was shining, the sweat was on his brow
His garments worn and dusty, his step seemed very slow
But he kept pressing onward, for he was going home
Still shouting as he journeyed, 'Deliverance will come!'

I saw him in the evening, the sun was bending low
He overtopped the mountain and reached the vale below
He saw that golden city, his everlasting home
And shouted loud 'Hosanna, deliverance will come!'

BRIDGE

Denn Siegespalmen und Ehrenkronen,
Siegespalmen sind unser Lohn.
