Sometimes I feel discouraged and cannot understand
The way the Father leads me, the way that He has planned
But you know best oh Lord, so draw me close to Thee
That I may feel Thy heartbeat bringing life to me.

CHORUS

The heartbeat of God means life and love to me
I don't want to be in doubt and troubled misery
So draw me closer Father up above
That I may always feel Your heartbeat of love.

Sometimes I live for self and God seems far away
But I'm the one who slips and I'm the one to stray
Oh Father please forgive each failure as I pray
And let me feel Your presence every passing day.

By faith I'll step right up and stand by Jesus' side
To feel the peak of love and there to safely hide
And I will trust in Him to see me safely through
Until in heav'n with Jesus, oh so real and true.
