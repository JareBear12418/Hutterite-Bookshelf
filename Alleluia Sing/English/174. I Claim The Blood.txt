I have a source of strength when I am weary
That takes me through when life is pressing me
I have a source of power from above
I'm covered over by a shield of love.

CHORUS

I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calvary
Those precious bloodstains were made there just for me
For all my sin, my sickness and my pain
When I need healing, I claim those precious bloodstains.

I do not know how others make it through
Who never go to Calvary as I do
For there the healing, cleansing stream still flows
With peace that only His redeemed can know.
