When I think of all the blessings Christ has given
How He saved my soul and took my sins away
I have a longing in my heart to be with Jesus
And I know the time can't be too far away.

CHORUS

I have a longing in my heart to see my Lord
I have a longing in my heart for His return
Too much trouble here to bear
Too much worries, too much care
I have a longing in my heart to see my Lord.

Many times the burdens seem so hard to carry
Many times I have to smile to hide my tears
But in heaven there won't be a cross to carry
And there'll be no sorrow through the countless cheers'
