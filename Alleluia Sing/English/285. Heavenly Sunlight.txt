Walking in sunlight all of my journey
Over the mountains, through the deep vale
Jesus has said, 'I'll never forsake thee'
Promise divine that never can fail.

CHORUS

Heavenly sunlight, heavenly sunlight
Flooding my soul with glory divine
Hallelujah, I am rejoicing
Singing His praises, Jesus is mine.

Shadows around me, shadows above me
Never conceal my Savior and guide
He is the Light, in Him is no darkness
Ever I'm walking close to His side.

In the bright sunlight, ever rejoicing
Pressing my way to mansions above
Singing His praises gladly I'm walking
Walking in sunlight, sunlight of love.
