Just as a sunrise upon a clear, spring day
Brings forth a beauty that the nighttime puts away
So comes that morning when God shall be the Light
That makes the glory of His city shine so bright.

CHORUS

Oh sweetest heaven, I'm longing to be there
Where Jesus dwells among the purest and the fair
For in that city I'll ever more be free
And walk those golden streets for all eternity.

Just as the sunrise brings forth the day that's new
And all the colors then break forth in brightest hue
So God will brighten a day that soon shall be
And then we'll see what in the night we could not see.

That heavenly sunlight will never fade away
Where all the angels know no ending of the day
And there forever we'll know a joy that's new
And our dear Savior's face will always be in view.
