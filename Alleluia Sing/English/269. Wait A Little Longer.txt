Here the labor is so hard and the workers are so tired
And our weary hearts are yearning for a rest
And we find we're getting anxious to be in that happy land
Where we receive such peace and happiness. (But-)

CHORUS

Wait a little longer, please Jesus
There are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer, please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in.

We may look into the skies and tears will fill our eyes
For our burdened heart grows heavier with each day
First we cry 'Oh Lord, please come, come and take your children home'
But then we look around us and we say:

The family scattered here and there, but Lord we love them dear
And maybe we can help them find the way
Then if waiting is the cause, they might not be lost
Lord, that's the only reason why we say:'
