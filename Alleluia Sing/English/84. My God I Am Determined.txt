In every waking moment
Thy gentle face I see
And hear Thy tender pleading
'Hast thou forsaken Me?'

CHORUS

My God I am determined
Forever Thine to be
I cannot live without Thee
For peace is found in Thee.

How oft' in desolation
When Satan bruised my soul
Have I embraced Thy mercy
And Thou hast made me whole.

When all my earthly pleasures
Had disappeared like foam
Amid my ruined treasures
Thy cross remained alone.

I keep Thy gentle image
Forever in my heart
That I may tell unceasing
How wondrous good Thou art.
