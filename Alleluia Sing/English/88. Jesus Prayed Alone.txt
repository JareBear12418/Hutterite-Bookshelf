Jesus went one night to a garden
To a place called Gethsemane
'Not My will, Thine be done'
Cried the Father's only Son
As He prayed in the garden alone.

CHORUS

Jesus prayed all alone in the garden
For a world He had claimed for His own
Long before my time to be
Christ the Lord included me
When He prayed in the garden alone.

I'm so glad He prayed in the garden
For my sins He suffered and died
He will call me someday
To my home far away
Then forever I'll be at His side. '
