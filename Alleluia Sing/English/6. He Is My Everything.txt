Some folks may ask me, some folks may say
Who is this Jesus you talk about everyday
He is my Savior, He set me free
Now listen while I tell you what He means to me.

CHORUS

He is my everything, He is my all
He is my everything, both great and small
He gave Himself for me, made everything new
He is my everything, now how about you?

How oft' I'm tempted, but praise the Lord
In the name of Jesus and His holy Word
I'm more than conqueror, I've Jesus within
I'm living the victory over Satan and sin.

He fills my soul with joy along life's way
He thrills me through and through each night and day
Anoints my head with oil, my cup o'erflows
Before I call in prayer, my Jesus He knows'
