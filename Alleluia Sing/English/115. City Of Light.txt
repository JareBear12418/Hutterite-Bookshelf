There's a city of light
Mid the stars we are told
Where they know not a sorrow or care
And the gates are of pearl
And the streets are of gold
And the buildings exceedingly fair.

CHORUS

Let us pray for each other
Not faint by the way
In this sad world of sorrow and care
For that home is so bright
And is almost in sight
And I trust in my heart you'll go there.

Brother dear, never fear
We shall triumph at last
If we trust in the Word He has given
When our trials and toils
And our weepings are past
We shall meet in that home up in Heaven.

Let us walk in the light
Of the gospel divine
Let us ever keep near to the cross
Let us love, watch and pray
In our pilgrimage here
Let us count all things else but as loss.
