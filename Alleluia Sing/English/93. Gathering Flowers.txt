Death is an angel sent down from above
Sent for the buds and the flowers we love
Truly 'tis so far in heaven's own way
Each soul is a flower in the Master's bouquet.

CHORUS

Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet
Beautiful flowers that will never decay
Gathered by the angels and carried away
Forever to bloom in the Master's bouquet.

Loved ones are passing each day and each hour
Passing away as the life of a flower
But every bud and each blossom some day
Will bloom as a flower in the Master's bouquet.

Let us be faithful till life's work is done
Blooming with love till the reaper shall come
Then we'll be gathered together for aye
Transplanted to bloom in the Master's bouquet'
