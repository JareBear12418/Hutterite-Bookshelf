Must I go, and empty-handed
Thus my dear Redeemer meet
Not one day of service give Him
Lay no trophy at His feet?

CHORUS

Must I go and empty-handed
Must I meet my Savior so
Not one soul with which to greet Him
Must I empty-handed go?

Not at death I shrink nor falter
For my Savior saves me now
But to meet Him empty-handed
Thought of that now clouds my brow.

Oh the years in sinning wasted
Could I but recall them now
I would give them to my Savior
To His will I'd gladly bow.

Oh ye saints, arouse, be earnest
Up and work while yet 'tis day
Ere the night of death o'er-take thee
Strive for souls while still you may.
