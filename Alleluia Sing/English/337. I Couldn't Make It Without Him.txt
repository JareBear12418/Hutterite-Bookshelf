He let me try my wings because I asked Him to
Knowing all the time I couldn't fly
He gave my feet their liberty and let them walk away
And all the time I never asked Him why.

CHORUS

But now I'm beginning to understand
He bought my life and He already it planned
Oh foolish me I could not see, sin had my vision dimmed
He let me go just so I would know that I couldn't make it without Him.

He let me choose my footsteps down the road of life
And farther from His care my feet have trod
The easy way was clear and bright without a cross to bear
But my road led me far away from God.
