Oh, spread the tidings round wherever man is found
Wherever human hearts and human woes abound
Let every Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound
The Comforter has come.

CHORUS

The Comforter has come, the Comforter has come
The Holy Ghost from Heaven, the Father's promise given
Oh, spread the tidings 'round wherever man is found
The Comforter has come.

The long, long night is past, the morning breaks at last
And hushed the dreadful wail and fury of the blast
As o'er the golden hills the day advances fast
The Comforter has come.

Lo the great King of kings, with healing in His wings
To every captive soul a full deliverance brings
And through the vacant cells the song of triumph rings
The Comforter has come.

Oh boundless love divine, how shall this tongue of mine
To wandering mortals tell the matchless grace divine
That I, a child of sin, should in His image shine
The Comforter has come.
