You can close your heart to others
And no courage you will share
For to sympathize great sorrow
You're afraid to even care
But just think what might have happened
If the One on Calvary
Had been afraid to care for you and me.

CHORUS

It takes courage to care
It takes strength to sympathize
It takes courage to show pity
Yes, it takes a man to cry
There was One who walked before us
Up the hill of Calvary
He had the courage to care for you and me.

You may build a shell around you
Until no one can get through
And your friends are only those
Who can do the most for you
You may think this way is easy
But the price you pay is high
For you're giving up the best things in life.
