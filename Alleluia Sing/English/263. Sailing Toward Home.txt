I stood upon a sandy bank
Looking out across the ocean
I watched the ships come safely in
To rest beside the shore
The friends of those aboard her
Were gathered there to greet them
It made me long for heaven
Where friends will part no more.

I'm sailing toward home
On the old ship of Zion
I see the lights upon the bank
Across the misty foam
Angels guard my vessel
Till I'm safe within the harbor
Captain guide my ship till I get home.

Now, Daddy sailed the seas of life
And knew the storms I'd weather
He told me of a Savior
Who could chart my destiny
Now the misty veil has lifted
I can plainly see the harbor
And Daddy standing on the bank
To smile and welcome me.

We're sailing toward home
On the old ship of Zion
I see the lights upon the bank
Across the misty foam
Angels guard my vessel
Till I'm safe within the harbor
Captain guide my ship till I get home'
