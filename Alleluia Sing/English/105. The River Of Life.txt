I know of a river whose beautiful stream
Flows gently and calm through the land
Its waters are pure for the healing within
'Tis flowing from Jesus our Friend.

CHORUS

Dear soul we pray will you come
And wash in this wonderful stream
This water flows free so clear and true
Believe, 'tis flowing for you.

To those that give heed it will blessings impart
Its flowing will not be in vain
For blessedness comes and peace in your heart
Redeems you from sorrow and pain.

To them that are thirsty the Spirit and bride
Say come, you may drink of it free
All those that are washed and in Jesus abide
Our Father in heaven receives.
