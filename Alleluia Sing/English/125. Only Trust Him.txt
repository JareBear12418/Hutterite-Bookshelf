Come, every soul by sin oppressed
There's mercy with the Lord
And He will surely give you rest
By trusting in His word.

CHORUS

Only trust Him, only trust Him
Only trust Him now
He will save you, He will save you
He will save you now.

For Jesus shed His precious blood
Rich blessings to bestow
Plunge now into the crimson flood
That washes white as snow.

Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way
That leads you into rest
Believe in Him without delay
And you are fully blessed.

Come, then, and join this holy band
And on to glory go
To dwell in that celestial land
Where joys immortal flow.
