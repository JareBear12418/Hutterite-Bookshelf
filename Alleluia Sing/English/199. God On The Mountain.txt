Life is easy when you're up on the mountain
And you've got peace of mind like you've never known
But then things change and you're down in the valley
Don't lose faith child, you are never alone.

CHORUS

For the God on the mountain
Is still God in the valley
When things go wrong He'll make it right
And the God of the good times
Is still God in the bad times
The God of the day is still God in the night.

You talk of faith when you're up on a mountain
But the talk comes easy when life's at its best
It's down in the valley of trials and temptations
That's when faith is really put to the test.
