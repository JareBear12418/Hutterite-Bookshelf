I will meet you in the morning
Just inside the eastern gate
SO be ready faithful pilgrim
Lest with you it be too late.

CHORUS

I will meet you (in the morning)
I will meet you (in the morning)
Just inside the eastern gate over there
I will meet you (in the morning)
I will meet you (in the morning)
I will meet you in the morning over there.

If you hasten off to glory
Linger near the eastern gate
For I'm coming in the morning
So you'll not have long to wait.

Oh the joy of that glad meeting
With the saints before us wait
He'll be with us at that meeting
Just inside the eastern gate.
