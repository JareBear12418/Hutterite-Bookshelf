I sing the mighty power of God that made the mountains rise
That spread the flowing seas abroad and built the lofty skies
I sing the wisdom that ordained, the sun to rule the day
The moon shines full at His command and all the stars obey.

I sing the goodness of the Lord that filled the earth with food
He formed the creatures with His word and then pronounced them good
Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed where e'er I turn my eye
If I survey the ground I tread or gaze upon the sky.

There's not a plant or flow'r below but makes Thy glories known
And clouds arise and tempests blow by order from Thy throne
While all that borrows life from Thee is ever in Thy care
And everywhere that man can be, Thou, God, art present there.
