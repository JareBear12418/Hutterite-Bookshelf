As I travel through this pilgrim land
There is a Friend who walks with me
Leads me safely through the sinking sand
It is the Christ of Calvary
This would be my prayer, dear Lord, each day
To help me do the best I can
For I need Thy light to guide me day and night
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.

CHORUS

Jesus hold my hand (blessed Jesus, hold my hand)
I need Thee every hour (yes, I need Thee every hour)
Through this pilgrim land (through this land, this pilgrim land)
Protect me by Thy power (protect me by Thy power)
Hear my feeble plea (hear my plea, my feeble plea)
Oh Lord, look down on me (Lord, dear Lord, look down on me)
When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there (when, I kneel in prayer)
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.

Let me travel in the light divine
That I may see the blessed way
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing redemption's song some day
I will be a soldier brave and true
And ever firmly take a stand
As I onward go and daily meet the foe
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.

When I wander through the valley dim
Toward the setting of the sun
Lead me safely to a land of rest
If I a crown of life have won
I have put my faith in Thee, dear Lord
That I may reach the golden strand
There's no other friend on whom I can depend
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
