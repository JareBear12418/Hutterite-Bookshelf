Are you a stranger to God
Carried away with your pride
Tell me sinner do you ever stop and think
Are you afraid to die?

CHORUS

Are you afraid
Are you unsaved
Are you afraid to die?

Call on Him while He is near
Moments are swift passing by
Will you seek Him while He still may be found
Are you afraid to die?

Are you too wicked to cry
Would you to God's bosom fly
Soon He's coming like a thief in the night
Are you afraid to die?

Be not ashamed of His word
Judgment will meet everywhere
Trust in your heart and the work is done
Leave your burdens there.
