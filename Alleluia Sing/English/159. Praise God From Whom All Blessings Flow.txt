Praise God from Whom all blessings flow
Praise Him, all creatures here below
Praise Him above, ye heavenly hosts
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

Ye nations 'round the earth rejoice
Before the Lord your Sovereign King
Serve Him with cheerful heart and voice
With all your tongues His glory sing.

The Lord is God, 'tis He alone
Doth life, and breath, and being give
We are His work, and not our own
The sheep that on His pasture live.
