If I survey all the good things that come to me from above
If I could count all the blessings from the storehouse of love
I'd simply ask for the favor of Him beyond mortal end
And I'm sure that He would grant it again.

CHORUS

I want to stroll over heaven with you some glad day
Where all the troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new
I want to stroll over heaven with you.

So many places of beauty we long to see here below
But time and treasures have kept us from making plans as you know
But come the morning of the rapture together we'll stand anew
While I stroll over heaven with you.
