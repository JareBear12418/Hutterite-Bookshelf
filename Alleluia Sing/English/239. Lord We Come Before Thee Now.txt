Lord we come before Thee now
At Thy feet we humbly bow
Oh do not our suit distain
Shall we seek Thee Lord in vain
Shall we seek Thee Lord in vain?

Lord on Thee our souls depend
In compassion now descend
Fill our hearts with Thy rich grace
To Thy lips to sing Thy praise
To Thy lips to sing Thy praise.

In Thine own appointed way
Now we seek Thee, here we stay
Lord, we know not how to go
Till a blessing Thou bestow
Till a blessing Thou bestow.

Grant that all may seek and find
Thee a God supremely kind
Heal the sick, the captive free
Let us all rejoice in Thee
Let us all rejoice in Thee.
