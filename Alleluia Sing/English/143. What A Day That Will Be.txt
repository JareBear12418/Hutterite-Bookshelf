There is coming a day when no heartache shall come
No more clouds in the sky, no more tears to dim the eye
All is peace forever more on that happy golden shore
What a day, glorious day that will be.

CHORUS

What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see
When I look upon His face, the One who saved me by His grace
When He takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land
What a day, glorious day that will be.

There'll be no sorrow there, no more burdens to bear
No more sickness, no pain, no more parting over there
Then forever I will be with the One who died for me
What a day, glorious day that will be.
