I walked one day along a country road
And there a stranger journeyed too
Bent low beneath the burden of His load
It was a cross, a cross I knew.

CHORUS

'Take up thy cross and follow Me'
I hear the blessed Savior call
How can I make a lesser sacrifice
When Jesus gave His all?

I cried, 'Lord Jesus', and He spoke my name
I saw His hands all bruised and torn
I stooped to kiss away the marks of shame
The shame for me that He had borne.

'Oh let me bear Thy cross, dear Lord', I cried
And 10 a cross for me appeared
The one forgotten I had cast aside
The one so long that I had feared.

My cross I'll carry till the crown appears
The way I journey soon will end
Where God himself shall wipe away all tears
And friend have fellowship with friend. '
