CHORUS

Jesus You are my life and inspiration
I give to You my life's dedication
Inspire my heart to do what is right
Jesus You are the inspiration of my life.

Oh Lord, You gave the light and salvation
How can I stand without condemnation
With Your precious blood, cover me forevermore
Oh Lord, your gift to me, salvation for my soul.

Father, give me strength and moderation
That I may walk in continuous preparation
For the time and day, when I shall see Your face
Father, give me strength and moderation every day.
