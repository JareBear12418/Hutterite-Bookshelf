Who at my door is standing
Patiently drawing near
Entrance within demanding
Who is the voice I hear?

CHORUS

Sweetly the tones are falling
'Open the door for Me
If thou will heed My calling
I will abide with thee.'

Lonely without He's standing
Lonely within am I
While I am still delaying
Will He not pass me by?

All through the dark hours dreary
Knocking again is He
Jesus, art Thou not weary
Waiting so long for me?

Door of my heart, I hasten
Thee will I open wide
Though He rebuke and chasten
He shall with me abide.
