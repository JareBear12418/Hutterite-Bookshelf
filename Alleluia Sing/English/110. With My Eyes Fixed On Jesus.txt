When the heartaches of this life seem like a mountain
And the joy and song within my heart is gone
Then I hear the gentle voice of Jesus calling
And in Him I find the reason to go on.

CHORUS

With my eyes fixed on Jesus, I can face another day
With my hand in my Savior's, I don't need to go astray
With my heart simply trusting, there are answers when I pray
In the shelter of His arms I want to stay (I want to stay).

When temptations like great waves come crashing round me
And my feeble feet are slipping in the sand
And there's nothing in this world to help or hold me
Then it's Jesus who alone can make me stand.

When dark doubts and fears come rolling like a river
And they're washing like a flood upon my soul
Then I find that there's an anchor in my Savior
When I trust in Him He takes complete control.
