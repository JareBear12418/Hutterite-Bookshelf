I will meet you in the morning, by the bright riverside
When all sorrow has drifted away
I'll be standing at the portals, when the gates open wide
At the end of life's long, dreary day.

CHORUS

I'll meet (meet you in the morning) you in the morning (meet you in the morning)
With a 'How ('How do you do) do you do' ('How do you do')
And we'll sit down (sit down by the river) by the river (sit down by the river)
And with rapture old acquaintance renew (rapture our old aquaintance renew)
You'll know (know me in the morning) me in the morning (know me in the morning)
By the smiles (smiles that I wear) that I wear (smiles that I wear)
When I meet you (meet you in the morning) in the morning (meet you in the morning)
In that city that is built (in that city, city built) foursquare (that city built foursquare).

I will meet you in the morning, in the sweet by and by
And exchange the old cross for a crown
There will be no disappointments there and nobody shall die
In that land where the sun goeth down.

I will meet you in the morning, at the end of the way
On the streets of that city of gold
Where we all can be together and be happy for aye
While the years and the ages shall roll.
