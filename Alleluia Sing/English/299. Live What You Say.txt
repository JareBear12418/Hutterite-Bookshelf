Don't say that you love Him, then live like you don't
You think they'll believe you, I tell you they won't
Don't think that this world is made up of fools
They're watching your life, do you live by the rules?

Don't say that He's very important to you
When everything else dominates what you do
They'll never believe you, unless they can see
Your words and your life together agree.

CHORUS

So just live what you say
Show them that Jesus is truly the way
Just live what you say
Someone is watching your life today.

So be an example in all that you do
Show them that Jesus is living in you
Speak of His power and love everyday
Live like you mean it, and show them the way.
