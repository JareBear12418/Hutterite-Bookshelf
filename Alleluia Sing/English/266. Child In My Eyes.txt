I was there when you drew the breath of life
And I heard your voice the first time that you cried
And though you couldn't see Me, I was very near
And there's something now that I want you to hear.

CHORUS

You will always be a child in My eyes
When you need some love My arms are open wide
Even when you're growing old I hope you realize
You will always be a child in My eyes.

I was there the first time that you prayed
And I heard all the promises you made
And when you fell before Me crying 'Father I have sinned'
I picked you up and held you close again.
