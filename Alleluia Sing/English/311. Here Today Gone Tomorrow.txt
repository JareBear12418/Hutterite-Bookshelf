I've been watching for the dawning of tomorrow
When we'll meet the blessed Savior in the sky
All these troubles of this world will then be over
And God will wipe all teardrops from our eyes.

CHORUS

We're here today, we'll be gone tomorrow
And this life won't even be a memory
We're here today, we'll be gone tomorrow
Where we'll praise the Lord throughout eternity.

Today we're getting ready for that final journey
And I'm making plans to live in my new home
Soon those eastern skies will bloom with clouds of glory
At the sounding of the trumpet we'll be gone.
