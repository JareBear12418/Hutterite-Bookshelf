Green and growing, or empty and cold
Are you as dry as the desert, or watered by His word
Plastic flowers, or living stacks of green
Is it man-made religion, or Jesus Christ the King?

CHORUS

Feed me, lord, on Your Word
Help me grow, on what I've heard
Strong and sturdy planted I'll be
Green and growing fields of love
With Jesus Christ in me.

Feel the showers of precious living rain
Water my thirsty soul, calling in His name
Holy Spirit, guide me in each prayer
I will grow a fruitful vine, in His love and care.
