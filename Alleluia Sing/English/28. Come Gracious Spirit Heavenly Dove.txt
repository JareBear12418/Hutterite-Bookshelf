Come gracious spirit, heavenly dove
With light and comfort from above
Be Thou our guardian, Thou our guide
O'er every thought and step preside
O'er every thought and step preside.

The light of truth to us display
And make us know and choose Thy way
Plant holy fear in every heart
That we from God may ne'er depart
That we from God may ne'er depart.

Lead us to holiness the road
Which we must take to dwell with God
Lead us to Christ the living way
Nor let us from His pastures stray
Nor let us from His pastures stray.

Lead us to God our final rest
To be with Him forever blessed
Lead us to heav'n its bliss to share
Fullness of joy forever there
Fullness of joy forever there.
