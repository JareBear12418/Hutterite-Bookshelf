I dreamed Mother walked up those heavenly stairs
And medals for mothers were given up there
It mentioned a million things Mom did for me
Things I took for granted and never could be.

CHORUS

If there's medals for mothers
For all of the deeds they have done
If there's medals for mothers
Mama you'll win every one.

A medal of honor was pinned on her there
A medal for patience and kind loving care
A medal for duty she won up above
But the biggest of all was the one for her love.
