Just over yonder, beyond the river
There is a city of pure delight
Where many loved ones are congregating
With palms of victory, with robes of white.

CHORUS

Just over yonder (yonder there)
There's be no heartaches (heartaches there)
No lonely days up there will ever come
There'll be no crying, there'll be no dying
Oh, what rejoicing when we get home.

There's nothing here friends but disappointment
So often here we are left alone
But over yonder, hearts will grow fonder
And separation will never come.

Just over yonder, we'll soon be going
To see the Savior upon His throne
And hear a welcome ring out through heaven
Oh weary pilgrim, this is your home.
