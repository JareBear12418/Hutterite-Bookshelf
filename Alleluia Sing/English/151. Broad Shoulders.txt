I took a long, long walk by the river
Had a quiet, peaceful talk with my Lord
He found my heart heavy with trouble
But our talk seemed to brighten my load.

CHORUS

My Jesus has broad shoulders
His back is stronger than mine
He was there the first time I called Him
He'll be there anyplace, anytime.

Now it's true that I've still got some troubles
But since Jesus and I had our talk
I found peace of mind and contentment
I'm so glad in His presence to walk.

So I'll keep on the right road to Heaven
For the way that He showed me is clear
And no matter what happens tomorrow
If I need Him I know He'll be there'
