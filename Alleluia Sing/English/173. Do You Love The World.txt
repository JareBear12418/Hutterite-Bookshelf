Do you love the world in its pomp and show
In its course of sin will you onward go
Is the pride of life more than heaven above
Will you lose your soul for the sins you love?

CHORUS

Do you love the world, will you selfish be
When the Lord provides everything for thee
Can you still refuse, will you come and bow
Give your heart and life to His service now.

Do you love the world, its applause and fame
Soon 'twill end in sorrow, remorse and shame
Jesus bids you come and redeem your soul
From its awful doom ere the judgments roll.

Do you love the world, is it dear to thee
Can it help thy soul in eternity
Will you choose its way more than godly fear
Sealing thus your doom when the Lord is near.

Do you love the world more than Christ who died
How the blood flow'd free from His pierced side
When it cost His life to prepare that place
Will you die in sin and refuse His grace?
