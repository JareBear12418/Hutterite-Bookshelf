Lord I am fondly, earnestly longing
Into Thy holy likeness to grow
Thirsting for more and deeper communion
Yearning Thy love more fully to know.

CHORUS

Open the wells (open the wells) of grace and salvation
Pour the rich streams (pour the rich streams) deep into my heart
Cleanse and refine (cleanse and refine) my thought and affection
Seal me and make (seal me and make) me pure as Thou art.

Dead to the world would I be oh Father
Dead unto sin, alive unto Thee
Crucify all the earthly within me
Emptied of sin and self may I be.

I would be Thine and serve Thee forever
Filled with Thy spirit, lost in Thy love
Come to my heart Lord, come with anointing
Showers of grace send down from above.
