There shall be showers of blessing
This is the promise of love
There shall be seasons refreshing
Sent from the Savior above.

CHORUS

Showers (showers, showers) of blessing
Showers of blessing we need
Mercy drops 'round us are falling
But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing
Precious reviving again
Over the hills and the valleys
Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of blessing
Send them upon us, oh Lord
Grant to us now a refreshing
Come, and now honor Thy word.

There shall be showers of blessing
Oh that today they might fall
Now as to God we're confessing
Now as on Jesus we call'
