Will your anchor hold in the storms of life
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife
When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain
Will your anchor drift, or firm remain?

CHORUS

We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.

It is safely moored, will the storm withstand
For tis well-secured by the Savior's hand
Though the tempest rage and the wild winds blow
Not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.

When our eyes behold through the gathering night
The city of gold, our harbor bright
We shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore
With the storms all past forevermore'
