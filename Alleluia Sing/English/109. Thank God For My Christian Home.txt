If you look on my family in pity
And wonder how we struggle alone
Then your eyes can't see all my riches
Thank God for my Christian home.

CHORUS

When I'm sad and discouraged from failure
And feel the whole world is against me and everything's wrong
All I need for courage is to whisper
Thank God for my Christian home.

I'm not seeking for riches nor power
In a world that I can't call my own
But I'm laying up treasures in Heaven
Where no sorrow will ever be known.

I will leave this old world like I found it
Taking with me no silver nor gold
But the strong hand of death hath not power
To break the circle of my Christian home'
