Heaven's gates I now can see, as they open wide for me
Swing wide the gates (swing wide the gates)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Angels sing a welcome song, and I know it won't be long
Swing wide the gates (swing wide the gates)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)

CHORUS

Swing wide the gates (swing wide the gates)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Swing wide the gates (swing wide the gates)
I'm one of His own (I'm one of His own)
I've fought the good fight, I've kept the faith
Amazing grace has won the race
Swing wide the gates (swing wide the gates)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home).

What a day that day will be when I cross that mystic sea
Swing wide the gates (swing wide the gates)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
With my Lord I'll ever be throughout all eternity
Swing wide the gates (swing wide the gates)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home).

When I land on heaven's shores, cares of life will be no more
Swing wide the gates (swing wide the gates)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
All is joy and peace up there, in a land of beauty rare
Swing wide the gates (swing wide the gates)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home).
