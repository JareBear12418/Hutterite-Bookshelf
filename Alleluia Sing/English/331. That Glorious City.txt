There is a place I read about in God's holy Word
It's built upon the mountainside, the New Jerusalem
The walls around that city are in layers of pure jewel
Twelve gates along the walls and every one a single pearl.

CHORUS

The glory of that city would blind these human eyes
More glorious still will be the face of Jesus Christ the King
In garments pure and white as snow we'll ~ather 'round the throne
And join the saints of yesterday in singing Home, sweet home'.

Inside the city walls I'm told are mansions of pure gold
Where death is vanished for all time, we'll never more grow old
We'll walk beside the river with the lion and the lamb
All worries will be gone and every pain be left behind.
