Oh your life is a canvas on which to portray
A picture of Christ and His Word
He provides the instructions and colors to use
To paint Christ a light to the world.

CHORUS

You are painting a picture of Christ with your life
Does your picture His beauty portray
Can the world in its darkness see Jesus shine through
In the picture you paint every day.

Do the colors shine true in the light of His Word
Are you painting with thought and with prayer
A picture of beauty and light to behold
In its beauty to shine everywhere.

Does the picture at times not appear to be true
Is its figure distorted somewhere
Do the colors seem dull and the beauty all gone
With the world a false picture you share.
