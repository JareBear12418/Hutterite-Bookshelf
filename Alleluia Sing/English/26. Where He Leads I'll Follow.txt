Sweet are the promises, kind is the word
Dearer more than any message man ever heard
Pure was the mind of Christ, sinless I see
He the great example is a pattern for me.

CHORUS

Where He leads I'll follow
Follow all the way
Where He leads I'll follow
Follow Jesus every day.

Sweet is the tender love Jesus hath shown
Sweeter far than any love that mortals have known
Kind to the erring one, faithful is He
He the great example is a pattern for me.

List' to His loving words, 'Come unto me
Weary, heavy laden, there is sweet rest for thee'
Trust in His promises, faithful and sure
Lean upon the Savior and thy soul is secure.
