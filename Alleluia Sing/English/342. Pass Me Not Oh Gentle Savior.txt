Pass me not, oh gentle Savior
Hear my humble cry
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by.

CHORUS

Savior, Savior
Hear my humble cry
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by.

Let me at a throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief
Kneeling there in deep contrition
Help my unbelief.

Thrusting only in Thy merit
Would I seek Thy face
Heal my wounded, broken spirit
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the spring of all my comfort
More than life for me
Whom have I on earth beside Thee
Who in heaven but Thee?'
