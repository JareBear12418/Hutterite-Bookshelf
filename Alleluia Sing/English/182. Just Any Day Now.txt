Each time I stop and take the time to look around me
I see the signs of His appearing everywhere
The things He said would come to pass are now before us
And I feel a strange excitement in the air.

CHORUS

Just any day now our Lord is coming
He'll be returning for you and me
For I've been watching and I've been waiting
Just any day now His face I'll see.

Oh, there's a longing in my heart for His appearing
I'll gladly leave behind these trials here below
For my journey has been long and I'm so weary
But Lord, somehow I feel I'm so much closer home.
