I look and see earth's gold and riches
The hoarding mob for selfish gain
The toil of hands for ease and comfort
I look again and see the falling golden grain.

CHORUS

Harvest time (harvest time). harvest time (harvest time)
The Savior's calling, the grain is falling
Oh do not wait, it's growing late
Behold the fields are white, it's harvest time.

Say not 'Four months, then comes the harvest'
For ripe the grain, ready to yield
Work while it's day for night is coming
Lift up thine eyes and see God's needy harvest field.

And when I stand before the Maker
And give account for what I've done
May I then hear Him saying to me
'Well done, My servant, you the crown of life have won.'

Oh, do not sleep while souls are dying
Awake, arise, there's much to do
At any price seek hard to win them
And then I'm sure there'll be a crown of life for you.

I prayed a prayer, 'Help me be faithful
In all my work for Christ the King'
To never waste a precious moment
Then when at last I'll all my trophies to Him bring.
