To God be the glory, great things He hath done
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin
And opened the lifegate that all may go in.

CHORUS

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice
Oh come to the Father through Jesus the Son
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.

Oh perfect redemption, the purchase of blood
To every believer the promise of God
The vilest offender who truly believes
When buried with Jesus a pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son
But purer and higher and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.
