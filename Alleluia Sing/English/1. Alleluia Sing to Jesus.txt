Melody: Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus

[G]Alleluia, sing to [D]Jesus
[G]His the scepter, [D]His the [G]throne
Alleluia, [C]His the [D]triumph
[G]His the victory[D] a[G]lone
Hark, the songs of [C]peaceful Zion
[G]Thunder like a mighty [D]flood
[G]Jesus, [D]out of [G]every [D]Nation
[G]Hath re[D]deemed us [G]by [D]His [G]blood.

Alleluia, not as orphans
Are we left in sorrow now
Alleluia, He is near us
Faith believes, nor questions how
Though the cloud from sight received
Him When the forty days were o'er
Shall our hearts forget His promise
'I am with you evermore'.

Alleluia, Bread of Heaven
Thou on earth our food and stay
Alleluia, here the sinful
Flees to Thee from day to day
Intercessor, friend of sinners
Earth's Redeemer, plead for me
Where the songs of all the sinless
Sweep across the crystal sea.
