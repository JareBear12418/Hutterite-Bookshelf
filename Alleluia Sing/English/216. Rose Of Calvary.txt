Many are the lovely flowers blooming with delight
Many are the joys of living when you re living right
Love is growing just in knowing someone cares for me
In my heart this rose is blooming, Rose of Calvary.

CHORUS

Share a blessing, so refreshing, fragrant flowers grow
Lovely thoughts and words and actions, everywhere you go
Share the fairest, share the rarest, for the world to see
Lovely Rose of Sharon blooming, Rose of Calvary.

Heaven's fragrance, lovely flowers, lamb of God divine
Lovely Rose of Sharon dying for your sins and mine
Love so pure and so refreshing, given full and free
Crushed and broken, bruised and bleeding, Rose of Calvary.

Many wounded hearts are bleeding, crying in despair
Many are the lost and lonely burdened down with care
Who will share the lovely flowers, for someone to see
Tell them of the Rose of Sharon, Rose of Calvary.

When you want to reach somebody, show them that you care
Say it with a lovely flower, fragrant and so rare
Such a lovely, kind expression let it always be
From the heart this lovely witness, Rose of Calvary.
