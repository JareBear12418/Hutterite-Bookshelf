I will pledge my heart to the love we share
Through the good and the bad times too
I'll forsake my rest for your happiness
Till my death I will stand by you.

With God as my witness, this vow I will make
To have and to hold you no other to take
For rich or for poor, under skies gray or blue
Till my death I will stand by you.

There are wars and there are rumors of wars yet to come
And temptations we'll have to pass through
Though others may tremble, I will not run
Till my death I will stand by you.

I will put on the armor of faithfulness
To fight for a heart that is true
Till the battle is won, I will not rest
Till my death i will stand by you.

With God as my witness, this vow I will make
To have and to hold you, no other to take
For rich or for poor, under skies grey or blue
Till my death I will stand by you.

Till the battle is won, I will not run
Till my death I will stand by you. '
