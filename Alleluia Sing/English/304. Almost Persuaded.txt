Almost persuaded, now to believe
Almost persuaded Christ to receive
Seems now some soul to say
Go, Spirit, go Thy way
Some more convenient day
On Thee I'll call.

Almost persuaded, come, come today
Almost persuaded, turn not away
Jesus Invites you here
Angels are lingering near
Prayers rise from hearts so dear
Oh, wanderer, come.

Almost persuaded, harvest is past
Almost persuaded, doom comes at last
'Almost' can not avail
'Almost' is but to fail
Sad, sad that bitter wail
Almost, but lost.
