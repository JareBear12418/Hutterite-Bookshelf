[A]Oh Lord my God, when I in [D]awesome wonder
Consider [A]all the worlds Thy [E]hands have [A]made
I see the stars, I hear the [D]rolling thunder
Thy power through[A]out the universe dis[A]played.

CHORUS

[A]Then sings my soul, my [D]Savior God, to [A]Thee
How great Thou [E]art, how great Thou [A]art
Then sings my soul, my [D]Savior God, to [A]Thee
How great Thou [E]art, how great Thou [A]art.

When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin.

When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art.
