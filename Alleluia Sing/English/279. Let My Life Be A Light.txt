Let me live blessed Lord in the light of Thy Word
Let my life be a light on a hill
Leading souls now astray to the straight narrow way
Help me do some good deed while I live.

CHORUS

Let my life be a light shining out through the night
May I help struggling ones to the fold
Spreading cheer everywhere to the sad and the lone
Let my life be a light to some soul.

Give me wisdom and power every day, every hour
Let me drink from the fountain above
Guide my footsteps a-right through the dark stormy night
Give me peace, give me joy, give me love.

Give me souls for my hire, let my life be on fire
Shining out to the world as a guide
Help me rescue someone sinking now with no hope
That in heaven we shall ever abide.
