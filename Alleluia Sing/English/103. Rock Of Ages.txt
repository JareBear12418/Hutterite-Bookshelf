There is a song that the world is singing
Bringing a message of hope and cheer
Rock of Ages (Ages cleft for me), cleft for me (cleft for me)
Many a time it has brought new courage
Driving away every doubt and fear
Rock of ages (Ages cleft for me), cleft for me (cleft for me).

CHORUS

Rock of Ages (Ages cleft for me), cleft for me, cleft for me
Let me hide (hide myself in Thee) myself in Thee (hide myself in Thee)
While the raging (raging waters roll) waters roll, near me roll
Rock of Ages (Ages cleft for me), cleft for me (cleft for me).

While I draw this fleeting breath
And when my eyelids close in death
Rock of Ages (Ages cleft for me), cleft for me (cleft for me)
When I rise to the worlds unknown
And when I behold Him on His throne
Rock of Ages (Ages cleft for me), cleft for me (cleft for me).

Till I have crossed o'er the rolling ocean
Let me hide, blessed Rock in Thee
Rock of Ages (Ages cleft for me), cleft for me (cleft for me)
Sing it to all of the weak and weary
Sing it again and again to me
Rock of Ages (Ages cleft for me), cleft for me (cleft for me)'
