In a world of fear and turmoil
In a race that seems so hard to run
Lord I need Thy rich in-filling
Even so Lord Jesus, come.

CHORUS

Even so Lord Jesus, come
My heart doth long for Thee
Though I've failed and betrayed Thy trust
Even so Lord Jesus, come.

When my eyes shall span that river
When I gaze into the vast unknown
May I say with calm assurance
Even now Lord Jesus, come.
