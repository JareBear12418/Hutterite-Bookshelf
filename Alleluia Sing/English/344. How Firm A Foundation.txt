How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
What more can He say than to you He hath said
Who unto the Savior for refuge have fled?

Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismayed
For I am thy God, I will still give thee aid
I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.

When through the deep waters I call thee to go
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow
For I will be with thee, thy trials to bless
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose
I will not, I will not desert to His foes
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
I'll never, no never, no never forsake.
