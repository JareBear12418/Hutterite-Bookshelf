When Jesus said 'If you believe on Me you shall be saved'
He included me, He included me
And when He said 'Fear not for I'll go with you all the way'
He included me, thank the Lord.

CHORUS

He included me, He included me
When He died to pay the price for sin upon the cross
He included me, He included me
He included me, thank the Lord.

When Jesus said He came to seek and save that which was lost
He included me, He included me
And when He said 'Forgive them' as He died upon the cross
He included me, thank the Lord.
