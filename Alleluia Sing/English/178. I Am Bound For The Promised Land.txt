On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie.

CHORUS

I am bound for the promised land
I am bound for the promised land
Oh, who will come and go with me
I am bound for the promised land.

All o'er those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day
There God the Son forever reigns
And scatters night away.

No chilling winds nor poisonous breath
Can reach that healthful shore
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death
Are felt and feared no more.

When shall I reach that happy place
And be forever blessed
When shall I see my Father's face
And in His bosom rest?'
