Angels never knew the joy that is mine
For the blood has never washed their sins away
Though they sing in Heaven there will come a time
When silently they listen to me sing 'Amazing Grace'.

CHORUS

It's a song holy angels cannot sing
'Amazing grace (amazing grace)
How sweet the sound (how sweet the sound)'
It's a song holy angels cannot sing
'I once was lost (I once was lost)
But now I'm found (but now I'm found).'

'Holy is the Lord,' the angels sing
All around the throne of God continually
And for me to join would be a natural thing
But they just don't know the words to 'Love Lifted Me'.
