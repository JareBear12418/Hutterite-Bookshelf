Tell me the story of Jesus, write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most precious, sweetest that ever was heard
Tell how the angels in chorus, sang as they welcomed His birth
'Glory to God in the highest, peace and good tidings to earth.'

CHORUS

Tell me the story of Jesus
Write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most previous
Sweetest that ever was heard.

Fasting alone in the desert, tell of the days that are past
How for our sins He was tempted, yet was triumphant at last
Tell of the years of His labor, tell of the sorrow He bore
He was despised and afflicted, homeless, rejected and poor.

Tell of the cross where they nailed Him, writhing in anguish and pain
Tell of the grave where they laid Him, tell how He liveth again
Love in that story so tender, clearer than ever I see
Stay, let me weep while you whisper 'Love paid the ransom for me.'
