Great and mighty is the Lord our God, great and mighty is He
Great and mighty is the Lord our God, great and mighty is He
Lift up the banner, let the anthems ring, praises to our King
Great and mighty is the Lord our God, great and mighty is He.

This is the day, this is the day
That the Lord has made, that the Lord has made
We will rejoice, we will rejoice
And be glad in it, and be glad in it
This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice and be glad in it
This is the day, this is the day that the Lord has made.

Celebrate, celebrate the glory of our God
Celebrate, celebrate His wisdom and His power
He has given us the victory
Celebrate the glory of our God

Never, never, never, have I ever, ever, ever
Been so happy, happy, happy in the Lord
Never, never, never have I ever, ever, ever
Been so happy in my life before
He took away my sadness and He filled my heart with gladness
And He have me all that I could not afford
Never, never, never, have I ever, ever, ever
Been so happy, happy, happy in the Lord.

I'm so glad Jesus lifted me
I'm so glad Jesus lifted me
I'm so glad Jesus lifted me
Singing glory hallelujah, Jesus lifted me.

Satan had me bound, but Jesus set me free
Satan had me bound, but Jesus set me free
Satan had me bound, but Jesus set me free
Singing glory hallelujah, Jesus set me free.

I'm on my way to heaven, I'm shouting victory
I'm on my way to heaven, I'm shouting victory
I'm on my way to heaven, I'm shouting victory
Singing glory hallelujah, Jesus set me free.

I'm so glad Jesus set me free
I'm so glad Jesus set me free
I'm so glad Jesus set me free
Singing glory hallelujah, Jesus set me free.
