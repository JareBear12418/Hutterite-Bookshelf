I don't need a candle light
To guide my way through the darkest night
I'll rest in the faith of Your power and might
And I will sleep beneath the light of Your love.

CHORUS

I will sleep beneath the light of Your love
It will guide my way till the sun comes up
If the moon and stars should fall from above
I will sleep beneath the light of Your love.

I don't need a lantern's glow
To keep me safe from all I don't know
Your watchful eyes will never close
And I will sleep beneath the light of Your love.

The day will come when kingdoms fall
The trumpet sounds for one and all
The strong will kneel and the proud will fall
And I will sleep beneath the light of Your love'
