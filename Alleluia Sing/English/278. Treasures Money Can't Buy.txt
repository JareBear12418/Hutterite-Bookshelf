While driving one day through the quiet country side
An old man was walking so I offered a ride
His face was all wrinkled his hair turned to gray
And these are the words that he had to say:

I may look like a beggar, but I'm rich as a king
What I have in my heart gives me reason to sing
I'm a joint heir with Jesus so why should I sigh
For these are the treasures that money can't buy.

CHORUS

Money is worthless when a soul is at stake
If gold bought redemption how much would it take
But He loved me and saved me and I can't explain why
And these are the treasures, these are the treasures that money can't buy.

So if you look at my garments and you notice they're torn
While I've a new royal garment that's never been worn
And a cabin I live in is home till I die
But I've a mansion in glory that money can't buy.
