Oft the way to the goal seems so weary and long
Trials almost take away our song
Then we sigh and we cry and we ask 'Father, why
Does this life my wishes all deny?'

CHORUS

My ways, My child are not your ways
My thoughts are higher than thine
Let Me lead you each step of this long weary day
Let Me clasp thy trembling hand in Mine.

It is my heart's desire to do His blessed will
And to serve my Master every day
But when things all go wrong and the world doubts me still
Then, oh Lord, I cannot understand.

So I'll leave all to Him, He has promised to share
All my load and every care to bear
There is joy in my heart and on my lips a song
Even though, Lord I don't understand.
