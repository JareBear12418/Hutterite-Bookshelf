Far and near the fields are teeming
With the waves of ripened grain
Far and near their gold is gleaming
O'er the sunny slope and plain.

CHORUS

Lord of harvest send forth reapers
Hear us Lord to Thee we cry
Send them now the sheaves to gather
Ere the harvest time pass by.

Send them forth with morn's first beaming
Send them in the noon-tide's glare
When the sun's last rays are gleaming
Bid them gather everywhere.

Oh thou whom thy Lord is sending
Gather now the sheaves of gold
Heavenward then at evening wending
Thou shalt come with joy untold'
