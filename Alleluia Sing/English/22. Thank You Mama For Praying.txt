Somebody, somewhere was praying that night
When Jesus came in and I saw the light
It must have been Mama, I'd heard her before
As she knelt by her bedside, her tears touched the floor.

CHORUS

Thank you Mama, for praying for me
If you had not prayed, then where would I be
They call you old-fashioned, but you love the Lord
And your prayers touch the Master, as your tears touch the floor.

She held to the altar and wouldn't give in
Till she knew all her children had been born again
Just an old-fashioned Mama but she loves the Lord
And her prayers touch the Master, as her tears touch the floor.
