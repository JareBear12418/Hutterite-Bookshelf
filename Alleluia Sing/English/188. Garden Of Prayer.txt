There's a garden where Jesus is waiting
There's a place that is wondrously fair
For it glows with the light of His presence
'Tis the beautiful garden of prayer.

CHORUS

Oh the beautiful garden, the garden of prayer
Oh the beautiful garden of prayer
There my Savior awaits as He opens the gates
In the beautiful garden of prayer.

There's a garden where Jesus is waiting
And He bids me to come meet Him there
Just to learn from His lips words of comfort
In the beautiful garden of prayer.

There's a garden where Jesus is waiting
And I go with my burdens and cares
Just to bow and receive a new blessing
In the beautiful garden of prayer.
