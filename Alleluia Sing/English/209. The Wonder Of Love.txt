There's something I know, I plainly can see
So gently it comes and settles on me
God made it in heaven, it comes from above
A beautiful something, the wonder of love.

CHORUS

The wonder of love to me is made known
(The wonder of love made known)
God's mercy and pardon so freely are shown
(God's mercy so freely shown)
Like rays of warm sunshine, it comes from above
(Like rays of the sun from above)
It touches me now, oh the wonder of love (God's love).

It stirs in my heart and makes my life glow
Gives meaning to life as onward I go
It brings hearts together that once were apart
This miracle wonder of love in my heart.

It touches my heart, its warmth I can feel
It shines on my path, I see it is real
It's cause for great changes, for miracles wrought
This God-given wonder of love in my heart.
