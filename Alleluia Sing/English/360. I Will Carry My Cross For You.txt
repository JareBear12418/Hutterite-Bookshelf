CHORUS

I will carry my cross for You
I'll walk in Your footsteps my whole life through
I'll do anything You will have me to do
Jesus, I will carry my cross for You.

Often in life we all find ourselves growing weary
But I fall on my knees and I callout Your name, and You hear me
You've always been my closest friend
Shown me Your mercy time and time again. (So-)

Many temptations may lay in the shadows before me
But with Your hand to guide me, I'll walk right on by, they won't lure me
You'd never turn Your love away
You've shown me forgiveness each and every day.
