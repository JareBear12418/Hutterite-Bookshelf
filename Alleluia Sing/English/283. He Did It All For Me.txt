I tried and tried to think of some good deed that I had done
That would give to me the right to claim a kinship to God's Son
Could it have been because I've tried in every way to please
Could it have been because I've spent some time down on my knees?

Could it have been because my heart was often touched with pain
Could it have been because I've often witnessed in His name
Or could it be that in the past some precious soul I've won
I searched my heart and realized it's nothing I have done.

CHORUS

The love of God defies all understanding of the mind
He chose to walk up Calvary's hill and die for all mankind
Those ugly scars He bore for me while hanging on the tree
Was the price of my redemption, and He did it all for me.

I hope I've been a trusted friend to someone on life's road
Shared a simple cup of water with a tired and thirsty soul
I've tried to be to those I meet as gentle as a dove
But I've never done a single deed that's worthy of His love.
