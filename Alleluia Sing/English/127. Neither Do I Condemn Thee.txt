By a crowd of worshippers, sorry for their sins
Was a poor wanderer rudely brought in
Scribes came and Pharisees, anxious to see
What the meek Nazarene's verdict would be.

They told of her wanderings, making each flaw
Spoke of her punishment, quoting the law
Writing upon the ground sadly and slow
But said He unheedingly, head bending low.

CHORUS

'Neither do I condemn thee, precious words divine'
From the lips of mercy like the sweetest chime
Wonderful words of Jesus, sing them o'er and o'er
'Neither do I condemn thee, go and sin no more.'

Still cried the Pharisees, 'Pray Master, pray
What shall we do with her, what does Thou say'
Then said He rebukingly, 'Let the first stone
Come from the sinless hands, hence and alone'.

Missing Verse
Cheeks flushing with the shame turning about,
And from His presence walking slowly out,
The saw me standing there head bending low
He whom all the world despised, bade her sin no more.

Spoke He most tenderly, 'Pray woman, pray
Hast thou no accusers', 'Nay, master, nay'
'Neither do I condemn thee, soul, sick and sore
Go forth, I pardon thee, go and sin no more'.
