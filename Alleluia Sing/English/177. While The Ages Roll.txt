Someday this stammering tongue will falter no more
And a grander, sweeter song I shall sing
For I'll join the ransomed choir on Heaven's bright shore
Forever to praise the King.

CHORUS

And while the ages roll I'll keep on praising Him
And my voice will never tire or grow old
And my song shall ever be, praise the Lamb who died for me
And I'll sing it while ages shall roll.

When a million years have passed in that wonderful place
My song of praise will just have begun
For my joy will never end while I look on His face
And my song will never be done.
