I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got another journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay
My one regret is leaving you behind.

But if it proves to be His will that I am first to cross
And somehow I've a feeling it will be
When it comes your time to travel likewise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see.

CHORUS

And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand.

Through this life we labor hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come, then we'll see paradise'
