Do you have the first love the Savior gave you
When you knelt at the altar that day
When you cried, 'Oh dear Lord, please have mercy
Save my soul, all my sins take away.'

CHORUS

Do you have the first love the Savior gave you
Is that fire still a-burning in your soul
Do you feel the same way that you did on that day
Does your zeal keep you pressing for your goal?

Have you drifted away from the Savior
Is the love that you had now grown cold
Won't you come and return and be faithful
Now is the time to be whole.
