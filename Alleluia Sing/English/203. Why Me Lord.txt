Why me, Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving You for the kindness You've shown.

CHORUS

Lord help me, Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus, I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed You so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in Your hands.

Try me Lord, if You think there's a way
I can try to repay, all I've taken from You
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself on my way back to You.
