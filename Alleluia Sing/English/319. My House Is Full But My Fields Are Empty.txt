There is peace and contentment in the Father's house today
Lots of food on His table and no one is turned away
There is singing and laughter as the hours pass by
But a hush calms the singing as the Father sadly cries:

CHORUS

My house is full but My fields are empty
Who will go and work for Me today
It seems My children all want to sit around My table
But no one wants to work in My fields.

Push away from the table, look out through the windowpane
Just beyond the house of plenty lies a field of golden grain
And it's white unto harvest but the reapers where are they
In the house, oh, can't the children hear the Father sadly say:
