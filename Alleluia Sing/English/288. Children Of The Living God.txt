Children of the living God
Come and sing, sing out loud
Children of the living God
Sing to the living God

Sing of the wonders He has made
Bird in flight, falling rain
Sing of the wonders He has made
Sing to the living God.

CHORUS

How He loves us with great love
He who sits enthroned above
For our lives He spilled His blood
Sent His spirit like a flood
Children of the living God
Sing to the living God.

Sing of His gentle healing hands
How they found the lowliest man
Sing of his gentle healing hands
Sing to the living God

Sing of the mercy that He gives
Though we sin he forgives
Sing of the mercy that He gives
Sing to the living God.

BRIDGE

Sing for the morning when He comes
In the clouds, glorious Son

Sing for the morning when He comes
Sing to the living God.
