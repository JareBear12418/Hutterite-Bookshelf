There's enough of God's love to fill the ocean deep
There's enough of God's love to scale a mountain's peak
There's enough of God's love to touch the highest star
There's enough of God's love to change a man's heart.

There's enough of God's love to make living life a real joy
There's enough of God's love, all hatred could be destroyed
If mankind would only try God's love for what it's worth
There's enough of God's love to bring peace on earth.

There's enough of God's love for everyone, everywhere
There's enough of God's love for anyone, anywhere
If the love of God would fill the heart of every man
There would still be enough left to do it again.
