Life is just a passing moment
On a never ending trail
Through my pathway wanders for a while
Someday my ship will sail.

CHORUS

But I will walk (I will walk) this road a while (road a while)
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take (I will take) it in my stride (in my stride)
Someday I'll (someday I'll) be satisfied.

There's eternity before me
Just beyond the darkening veil
Oh my spirit hollers on to go
Someday my ship will sail.
