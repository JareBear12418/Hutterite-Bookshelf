CHORUS

Greater is He that is in me
Greater is He that is in me
Greater is He that is in me
Than he that is in the world.

Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro
Seeking whom he may devour; the Bible tells me so
Many souls have been his prey, to fall in some weak hour
But God has promised us today His overcoming power.

On the day of Pentecost, a rushing mighty wind
Blew into the upper room, and baptized all of them
With a power greater than any earthly foe
And I'm so glad I've got it too, I'll let the whole world know.
