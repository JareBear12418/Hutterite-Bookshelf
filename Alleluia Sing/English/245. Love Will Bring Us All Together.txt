To the River of Jordan, our Savior went one day
And we read that John the Baptist met Him there
When John baptized Jesus in Jordan's rushing waters
The mighty power of God filled the air.

I'm on my way (to the River of Jordan)
Gonna wade right in (in the rushing waters)
I'm going down (I'm going down) to the River of Jordan
And let the cool waters cleanse my soul.

King Naaman was stricken with dreaded leprosy
So he sent for the man of God to pray
But Elisha said to Naaman 'Go dip yourself in Jordan
And let the cool water wash your spots away.'

So he went right down (to the River of Jordan)
He waded right in (to the rushing waters)
He dipped himself (he dipped himself) in the River of Jordan
And the cool waters made him whole.

The River of Jordan is many miles away
This mighty river I may never see
But I'll find myself an altar in an old-fashioned church
And my River of Jordan that will be.

I'm on my way (to the River of Jordan)
Gonna wade right in (in the rushing waters)
I'm going down (I'm going down) to the River of Jordan
And let the cool waters cleanse my soul.
