Love like this was never know
Though you searched the whole world round
Jesus dying for His own
Just as the sun went down.

CHORUS

Just as the evening sun
(Just as the evening sun, just as the evening sun)
Was sinking in the golden west
Hanging between two thieves
(Hanging between two thieves, hanging between two thieves)
They crucified the Son of God (the Son of God)
Mocked by the multitude
(Mocked by the multitude, mocked the multitude)
They placed on Him a thorn-made crown
Love (love like this was never known)
Love (Jesus dying for His own)
Just as the sun went down.

By Sanhedrin He was tried
'Have no use for Him,' they cried
By the mob He was crucified
Just as the sun went down.
