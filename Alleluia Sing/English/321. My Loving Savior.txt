One day when the golden sun was shining
They led Him up to Calvary's Mountain
And crucified the King of Glory
And the sun refused to give her light.

CHORUS

They crucified my loving Savior
They nailed Him to the cruel tree
And there He bled and died in anguish
And the sun refused to give her light.

One day when the sun is still shining
God's trumpet will blow and give its sign
And call the things of God together
And the sun will refuse to give her light.
