Wonderful things of folks are said
When they have passed away
Roses adorn the narrow bed
Over the sleeping clay.

CHORUS

Give them the roses while they live
Trying to cheer them on
Useless the flowers that you give
After the soul is gone.

Praises are heard not by the dead
Roses they cannot see
Let us not wait till souls have fled
Generous friends to be.

Faults are forgiven when folks lie
Cold in the narrow bed
Let us forgive them 'ere they die
Now should the words be said.
