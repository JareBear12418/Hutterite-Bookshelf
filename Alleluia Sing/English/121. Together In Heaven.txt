You may have a fancy car
Brand new house that shines by far
You may live to be a hundred years old
But if you have not been saved
It all ends with the grave
But I want us to be together in heaven.

CHORUS

I want us to be together in heaven
I want to walk down the streets of pure gold
I want to run through the fields of green clover
See the mansions, smell the flowers
Hear the singing, it's all hours
See the river gently flowing
Feel the gentle breezes blowing
I want us to be together in heaven.

You may be a millionaire
Wearing clothes beyond compare
You may have the best that money can buy
But if the blood is not applied
Then in hell you'll lift your eyes
But I want us to be together in heaven.
