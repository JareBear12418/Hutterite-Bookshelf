Moses led God's children
Forty years he led them
Through the cold and through the night
Though they said 'Let's turn back'
Moses said 'Keep going
Canaanland is just in sight.'

CHORUS

There will be no sorrow
There in that tomorrow
We will be there by and by
Milk and honey flowing
That is where I'm going
Canaanland is just in sight.

Though we walk through valleys
Though we climb high mountains
We will not give up the fight
We must be like Moses
We must keep on going
Canaanland is just in sight.
