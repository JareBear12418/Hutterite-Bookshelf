Some day when I've traveled my last mile here
The call will be coming for me
I'll enter the lifeboat that will be near
To carry me over the sea.

CHORUS

He'll hold my hand (hold to my hand, hold to my hand)
As over death's river I go (I go)
Then safe I'll be (safe I will be, safe I will be)
In beautiful heaven I know.

My barge shall sail safely though waves dash high
For Jesus will be at my side
He'll still the rough waters when by and by
I'm crossing the river so wide.

I'm ready to go to that golden shore
To live there while ages shall roll
I want to see Jesus and saints of yore
In heaven, the home of the soul'
