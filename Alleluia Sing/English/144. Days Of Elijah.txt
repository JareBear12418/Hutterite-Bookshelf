These are the days of Elijah
Declaring the Word of the Lord
And these are the days of His servant, Moses
Righteousness being restored
And these are the days of great trial
Of famine and darkness and sword
So we are the voice in the desert crying
'Prepare ye the way of the Lord!'

CHORUS

Behold He comes, riding on a cloud
Shining like the sun at the trumpet's call
Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes.
And these are the days of Ezekiel
With dry bones becoming as flesh
And these are the days of His servant, David
Building the temple of praise

And these are the days of the harvest
The fields are all white in the world
And we are the laborers that are in Your vineyard
Declaring the word of the Lord.

BRIDGE

There's no God like Jehovah. (repeat)'
