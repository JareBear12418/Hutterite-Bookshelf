When it seems that the world is on your shoulders
While sinking beneath the hill you try to climb
Just ask the Lord to come and be your Savior
And He will climb with you all the time.

CHORUS

Try God (try God)
When the way grows weary that you trod
Try prayer (try prayer)
When the load is heavy that you bear
Let's try love (try love)
Show the world around us that we care
Let's try love, try prayer, try God.

He set my feet on higher ground
A friend like no other in Him I have found
He lifted me when I was down
And by His grace, I've heavenbound.
