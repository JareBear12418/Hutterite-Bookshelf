I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one, that's silver-lined.

CHORUS

I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder we'll never more wander
But walk on streets that are pure as gold.

Though oft' I'm temped, tormented and tested
And like a prophet, my pillow a stone
And though I find here no permanent dwelling
I know He'll give me a mansion my own.

Don't think me poor or deserted and lonely
I'm not discouraged, I'm Heaven bound
I'm just a pilgrim in search of a city
I want a mansion, a harp and a crown.
