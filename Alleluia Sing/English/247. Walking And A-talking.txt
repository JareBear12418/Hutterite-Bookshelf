On your journey to the grave
Would you stop and try to save
Are you walking and a-talking with the Lord
Would you lend a helping hand
To some poor sinner man
Are you walking and a-talking with the Lord?

CHORUS

Are you walking (are you walking)
Are you talking (are you talking)
Are you walking and a-talking with the Lord
Are you traveling in His light
Every day and every night
Are you walking and a-talking with the Lord?

If your heart said testify
Would the world hear your reply
Are you walking and a-talking with the Lord
Would you stand and shout His name
Or bow your head in shame
Are you walking and a-talking with the Lord?

When the time has come to go
Will your robe be white as snow
Are you walking and a-talking with the Lord
Will He take you by the hand
Lead you to that promised land
Are you walking and a-talking with the Lord?'
