Alas, and did my Savior bleed
And did my Sovereign die
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I.

CHORUS

At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the Light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day.

Was it for crimes that I have done
He groaned upon the tree
Amazing pity, grace unknown
And love beyond degree.

Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in
When Christ the mighty Maker died
For man the creature's sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe
Here Lord, I give myself away
'Tis all that I can do.
