Old Daniel of old, he was asked not to pray
To his God up in Heaven in his own usual way
But still he knelt down three times every day
So to the lions he was thrown, but still he did say:

CHORUS

I will not bow down to your heathen gods today
I will not kneel down to your images and pray
There is no other God but the God I serve above
And I'll not worship another but my Lord.

King Nebuchadnezzar thought he was great and could not fall
So he build a great big idol and said 'Worship one and all'
When the three Hebrew boys refused to kneel and pray
To the fiery furnace they were thrown, but still they did say:

Sometimes in this life Satan tells us to stray
He says 'Worship fame and fortune and the pleasures of today'
But there's only one God, and there's only one way
If we keep our eyes on Jesus like the men of old, we'll say:'
