Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Till we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore.

CHORUS

If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its care
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the side of the river of life

Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separations come never more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore.

Oh so often we're parted with sorrow
Benedictions often quicken our pain
But we never shall have sorrow in heaven
God be with you till we meet again.

Oh they say we shall meet by the river
Where no storm clouds ever darken the sky
And they say we'll be happy in heaven
In the wonderful sweet by and by.
