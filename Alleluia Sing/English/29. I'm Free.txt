So long I had searched for life's meaning
Enslaved by the world and my greed
Then the door of my prison was opened by love
For the ransom was paid, I was free.

CHORUS

I'm free from the fear of tomorrow
I'm free from the guilt of the past
For I've traded my shackles for a glorious song
I'm free, praise the Lord, free at last.

I'm free from the guilt that I carried
From the dull, empty life I'm set free
For when I met Jesus He made me complete
He forgot how foolish I used to be.
