Abide with me, I need Thee every day
To lead me safe through all the weary way
When storms surround and only clouds I see
Lord be my comfort and abide with me.

Be with me Lord, where'er my path may lead
Fulfill my word, supply my every need
Help me to leave each day more close to Thee
And oh dear Lord, I pray, abide with me.

Abide with me, my Lord and when at last
This earth and all its weary cares are past
I'll pray no more that Thou abide with me
For then at last I shall abide with Thee.
