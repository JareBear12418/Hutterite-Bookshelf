Could I have just one minute of your time, dear brother
There is something that I've got, walking through my mind
I know you are busy with so many things to do
But how I need an answer, if you can spare the time.

CHORUS

Do we take enough time with our children, dear brother
Teaching and praying to ease their troubled mind
Giving them love, the kind of love they need
So tell me dear brother, do we take enough time?

We are all so busy trying to earn an extra dime
The next thing we know, our children all are grown
Now our children are grown and we have our extra dime
I wonder dear brother, did we take enough time?

Now all those riches that we earn in this world
Will not make a difference when we get our reward
So let's teach love and pray and keep in our minds
That we would be much happier if we took a little more time.
