When you've strayed from the fold
And there's trouble in your soul
Can't you hear the blessed Savior calling you
When your soul is lost in sin
And you're at your journey's end
Can't you hear the blessed Savior calling you?

CHORUS

Calling you (calling you). calling you (calling you)
Can't you hear the blessed Savior calling you
He will take you by the hand
Lead you to that promised land
Can't you hear the blessed Savior calling you?

As you journey day by day
And temptation comes your way
Can't you hear the blessed Savior calling you
If you follow in His light
He will always guide you right
Can't you hear the blessed Savior calling you?

When your soul is burdened down
And your friends cannot be found
Can't you hear the blessed Savior calling you
If you follow Him each day
He will brighten up your way
Can't you hear the blessed Savior calling you?'
