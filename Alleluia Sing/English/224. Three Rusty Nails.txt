With three rusty nails they nailed Jesus to the tree
The sun turned to darkness on that day
'Twas the day that Jesus died and the blood flowed from His side
The blood that washed my sins away.

Jesus cried 'Forgive them, Lord, for they know not what they do
For they have strayed so far, far away'
With three old rusty nails, they took Jesus' precious blood
The blood that washed my sins away.

They laughed as He cried, soldiers pierced His naked side
And His Father turned His face away
They drove the nails so deep, spilled His blood and made Him weep
The blood that washed my sins away.
