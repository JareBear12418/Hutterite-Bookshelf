The Artist lifted the canvas
And sketched each line carefully
I watched as the picture unfolded
It was shaped in the image of me
The shadows were deepened with sorrow
The brow was wrinkled with pain
The eyes were sad and so empty
A picture of sorrow and shame.

He painted a heart that was broken
Torn and scared deep within
Embittered from life's disappointments
And framed with the blackness of sin.

I looked in the eyes of the Artist
I trembled and reached for His hand
I cried 'Oh Master Creator
Transform me and paint me again'
So He smiled and lifted the canvas
And started all over again
Remolding and shaping the image
How graceful the touch of His hand.

He painted a heart that was mended
Erased all guilt and the sin
And framed it with colors of crimson
I posed and He painted again.
