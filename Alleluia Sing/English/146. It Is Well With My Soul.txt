When peace, like a river, attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul.

CHORUS

It is well (it is well) with my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
let this blest assurance control
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin, not in part, but the whole
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more
Praise the lord, praise the lord, oh my soul.

And lord haste the day when my faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound and the lord shall descend
Even so, it is well with my soul.
