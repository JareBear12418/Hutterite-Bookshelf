Come let us worship and bow down
Let us kneel before the Lord our God, our Maker
Come let us worship and bow down
Let us kneel before the Lord our God, our Maker.

CHORUS

For He is our God
And we are the people of His pasture
And the sheep of His hand
Just the sheep of His hand.

Come let us praise the Lord most high
Let us honor His name above all others
Come let us praise the Lord most high
Let us honor His name above all others.

Come let us glorify and sing
Let us raise our voices to the Rock of Ages
Come let us glorify and sing
Let us raise our voices to the Rock of Ages'
