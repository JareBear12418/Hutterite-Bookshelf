There's a call comes ringing o'er the restless wave
Send the light, send the light
There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save
Send the light, send the light.

CHORUS

Send the light, the blessed gospel light
Let it shine from shore to shore
Send the light, and let its radiant beams
Light the world forevermore.

We have heard the Macedonian call today
Send the light, send the light
And a golden offering at the cross we lay
Send the light, send the light.

Let us pray that grace may everywhere abound
Send the light, send the light
And a Christlike spirit everywhere be found
Send the light, send the light.

Let us not grow weary in the work of love
Send the light, send the light
Let us gather jewels for a crown above
Send the light, send the light.
