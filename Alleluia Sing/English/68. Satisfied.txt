All my life long I had panted
For a drink from some cool spring
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst I felt within.

CHORUS

Hallelujah, I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved
Jesus satisfies my longings
Through His blood I now am saved.

Feeding on the husks around me
Till my strength was almost gone
Longed my soul for something better
Only still to hunger on.

Poor I was, and sought for riches
Something that would satisfy
But the dust I gathered round me
Only mocked my soul's sad cry.

Well of water, ever springing
Bread of life so rich and free
Untold wealth that never faileth
My Redeemer is to me.
