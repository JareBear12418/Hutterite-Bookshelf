There's a deep silent river flowing just before
And it's waters are deep and wide
But faith sees the light, yes a beckoning light
Just down by the riverside.

CHORUS

There's a light at the river, a light at the river
There's a light at the river I can see
My Lord will stand and hold in His hand
A light at the river for me.

To that deep silent river we will one day come
We'll cross over waters wide
But they'll carry us away to the realms of day
To our home on the other side.

Many dear ones have gathered safe before the throne
Dipped their wings in the mystic tide
They have passed over deep where they do not weep
To their home on the other side.
