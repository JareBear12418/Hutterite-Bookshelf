While strolling along in the country
Reviewing the scenes new and old
I found an old-fashioned log cabin
So beautiful there to behold.

A stranger was standing in silence
His eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him
For these were the words that it bore.

And a sign read, 'A old cabin for sale
An old oaken bucket and well
Easy terms: just keep a log on the fire
And a light burning bright in the dell.'

Many years an old couple so patiently looked
For their boy whose last promise did fail
Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more
There's an old log cabin for sale.

A 'welcome' I read on the floor mat
An old braided rug by the door
The hands of an angel had made them
With many a prayer prayed before.

In an old rocking chair, oh, she waited
For one glimpse of him, how she yearned
And now he was standing in silence
Too late, yes, too late he'd returned.
