Just as I am without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee
Oh Lamb of God I come, I come.

Just as I am and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
Oh Lamb of God I come, I come.

Just as I am though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt
Fightings and fears within, without
Oh Lamb of God I come, I come.

Just as I am poor, wretched, blind
Sight, riches, healing of the mind
Yea all need in Thee I find
Oh Lamb of God I come, I come.

Just as I am Thou wilt receive
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
Because Thy promise I believe
Oh Lamb of God I come, I come.

Just as I am thy Love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down
Now, to be thine, yeah thine alone
Oh, Lamb of God I come, I come'
