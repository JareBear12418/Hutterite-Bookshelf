Way up in Heaven there's a place that is free from all care
Where there's no trouble, no worries, no burdens to bear
Jesus has made it a place for the righteous to live
Made it a place where the rich and the poor are the same.

Here on this earth we are told to obey His command
Stand by the Savior and cling to His unchanging hand
And if we serve Him we'll reap our reward by and by
When we have entered that beautiful city on high.

When we have taken our last journey up to the sky
When we have looked on the face of our Savior and King
When we have walked through that beautiful city on high
Jesus will take us into His fast growing fold.

Friends while you're living won't you try and live for the King
Praise Him and serve Him with the words and the music you sing
Time swiftly passes, soon your life on this earth will be done
Then up in Heaven inherit that beautiful throne.
