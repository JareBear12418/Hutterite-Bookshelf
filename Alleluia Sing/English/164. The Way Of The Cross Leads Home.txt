I must needs go home by the way of the cross
There's no other way but this
I shall ne'er get sight of the Gates of Light
If the way of the cross I miss.

CHORUS

The way of the cross leads home (leads home)
The way of the cross leads home (leads home)
It is sweet to know as I onward go
The way of the cross leads home.

I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way
The path that the Savior trod
If I ever climb to the heights sub-lime
Where the soul is at home with God.

Then I bid farewell to the way of the world
To walk in it never more
For my Lord says, 'Come,' and I seek my home
Where He waits at the open door.
