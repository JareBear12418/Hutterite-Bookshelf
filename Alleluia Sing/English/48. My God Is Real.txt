Some people say there is no God up in the Heavens
They say He did not send His Son for us to die
They mock His name and through their shame they live without Him
But I believe in God and I can tell you why.

CHORUS

His hand created all the stars that light the heavens
His tender touch brought forth the beauty of the rose
His love so free He gave to me, that's why I praise Him
My God is real, He's real to me all Heaven knows.

I may not understand the mystery of a snowflake
I may not know what makes the tiny flowers grow
The knowledge that great men have had I know eludes me
But I believe in God, He's real, He lives I know.

A thousand men may say it's all imagination
But they don't know and understand the way I feel
Could I express the happiness that overwhelms me
I'll tell the world till all will know that God is real.
