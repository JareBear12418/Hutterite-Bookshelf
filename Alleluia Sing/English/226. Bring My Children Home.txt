I can hear a distant cry
Shouting out 'The time is nigh'
As the Father tells the Son
'Work on earth this day is done.'

CHORUS

Son, go bring My children home
For I want them gathered 'round My throne
It's time to reap the harvest You have sown
Son go bring (Son go bring) My children home.

What a joy to see His face
In His arms we will embrace
Never more we'll have to roam
For we've finally made it home.
