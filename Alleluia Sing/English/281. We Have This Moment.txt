Hold tight to the sound of the music of living
Happy songs from the laughter of children at play
Take my hand as we run through the sweet fragrant meadows
Making memories of what was today.

CHORUS

We have this moment to hold in our hands
And to touch as it slips through our fingers like sand
Yesterday's gone and tomorrow may never come
But we have this moment today.

Tender words, gentle touch and a good cup of coffee
And someone who loves me and wants me to stay
Hold them near, while they're here and don't wait for tomorrow
And look back and wish for today.

Take the blue of the sky and the green of the forest
And the gold and the brown of the freshly mown hay
And the pale shades of spring and the circuit of autumn
And review how lovely today.
