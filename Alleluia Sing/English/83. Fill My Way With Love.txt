Let me walk blessed Lord
In the way Thou hast gone
Lead me straight to the land of love
Giving cheer everywhere
To the sad and the lost
Fill my way every day with love.

CHORUS

Fill my way every day with love
As I walk with the heavenly dove
Let me go all the while
With a song and a smile
Fill my way every day with love.

Keep me close to the side
Of my Savior and guide
let me never in darkness roam
Keep my path free from wrath
And my soul satisfied
Fill my way everyday with love.

Soon the race will be o'er
And I'll travel no more
And I'll fly to my home above
Let me sing blessed King
All the way to the shore
Fill my way every day with love'
