My heart can sing when I pause to remember
A heartache here is but a stepping stone
Along the trail that's winding always upward
This troubled world is not my final home.

CHORUS

But until then my heart will go on singing
Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold that city
Until the day God calls me home.

The things of earth will dim and lose their value
If we recall they're borrowed for a while
The things on earth that cause this heart to tremble
Remember there will only bring a smile.

This weary world with all its toils and struggles
May take its toll of misery and strife
The soul of men is like a waiting eagle
When it's released, is destined for the skies.
