I don't know why the angels listen
I don't know why the dawn is gray
I don't know how God paints the rainbow
But I know He's here today.

CHORUS

He is there when dreams have failed me
When I'm weak and cannot stand
And when the storms of doubt assail me
I reach out and find His hand.

I don't know why a benediction
Is often found in mother's prayer
I don't know how her smile caresses
But I know that God is here.

I don't know how some humble cottage
Oft shelters all with love to spare
Nor how God makes that home a heaven
But I know that He is there.

I don't know why, when in the chapel
His presence oft comes stealing there
Nor how He lines the clouds with silver
But I know He answers prayer.
