This is the journey we are on
As we travel down this road
Although the traveling seems long
And we bear a load, but all of who we are
Are turns along the way and we keep turning
We are going home (we are going home)
Going to our destination
But for now, going home(we are going home)
With great anticipation
Though the valleys may seem deep
And mountains that we climb seem much too steep
We will travel on (we will travel on).

Sometimes the baggage on our back
It is dragging us behind
Causes us to stumble off the track
We will lose in time, but if we go in faith
We'll find our way back to the road again
We are going home (we are going home)
Going to our destination
But for now, going home(we are going home)
With great anticipation
Though the valleys may seem deep
And mountains that we climb seem much too steep
We will travel on (we will travel on).

We will help our brothers along the way
We will hold their hand if they fall away
And we'll walk together in harmony
Till we reach the place where we long to be.

We will help our brothers along the way
We will hold their hand if they fall away
And we'll walk together in harmony
Till we reach the place where we long to be

We will travel on (we will travel on)
We will travel on (we will travel on)
We are here but soon we'll be gone
We will travel, travel on.

We will travel on (we will travel on)
We will travel on (we will travel on)
We are here but soon we'll be gone
We will travel, travel on.
