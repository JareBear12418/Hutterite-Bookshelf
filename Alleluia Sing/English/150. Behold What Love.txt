Behold what love, yes love divine
The Father showed to thee
In that He gave His only Son
Thy soul from sin to free.

CHORUS

Such love cannot be fathomed
'Tis like the boundless sea
His broken heart so wounded
Is bleeding now for thee.

He gave His life to make thee whole
He shed His blood for all
To heal the body, save the soul
Then come for mercy call.

Oh depths of love to mortals lost
He suffered on the tree
Our only hope of heaven cost
His blood - 'twas all for thee.

The love of Christ is warm and free
We live because He died
His drops of mercy fallon thee
And all the world beside.
