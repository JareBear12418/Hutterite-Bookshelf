While the world looks upon me as I travel along
They say I have nothing but they are so wrong
In my heart I'm rejoicing, how I wish they could see
Thank You Lord for Your blessings on me.

CHORUS

There's a roof up above me, I've a good place to sleep
There's food on my table and shoes on my feet
You gave me Your love, lord, and a fine family
And I thank You lord for Your blessings on me.

Although I'm not wealthy and these clothes, they're not new
I don't have much money but Lord I have You
And to me that's all that matters, though the world may not see
And I thank You Lord for Your blessings on me.
