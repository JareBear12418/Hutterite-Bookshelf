What a fellowship, what a joy divine
Leaning on the everlasting arms
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

CHORUS

Leaning (leaning on Jesus), leaning (leaning on Jesus)
Safe and secure from all alarm
Leaning (leaning on Jesus), leaning (leaning on Jesus)
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way
Leaning on the everlasting arms
Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

What have I to dread, what have I to fear
Leaning on the everlasting arms
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
