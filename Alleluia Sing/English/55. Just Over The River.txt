Just over the river, just over the river
I'm told is the city of God
Its gates are of pearl and its streets are of gold
And by glorified beings there trod
And Jesus my Savior has gone to that city
A place for His own to prepare
In the house of the Father the mansions are many
And one is awaiting me there.

CHORUS

Just over the river (just over the river, just over the river)
That beautiful city I see
Just over the river (and Jesus my Savior has gone to make ready)
A place in that city for me.

Just over the river, just over the river
That city that knoweth no night
It needeth no sun, neither needeth the moon
For the glory of God is its light
In that city are loved ones awaiting my coming
Expectant they stand on the shore
Oh, when shall I enter my mansion in Heaven
A pilgrim to roam never more.

Just over the river, just over the river
No sorrow will ever be known
A crown will waiting for those who have suffered
And Jesus will come for His own
The way may be dark but the love-light is gleaming
Beyond in that city so fair
Oh, soon I'll be crossing that dark rolling river
To dear ones awaiting me there.

Just over the river are mansions of glory
So long by the Savior foretold
There dwell the immortals in rapture above
Where the streets are all paved with pure gold
There dwelleth the Father and Christ the Redeemer
In glory and splendor arrayed
Where praise shall resound from the lips of the ransomed
To Him who our sin debt has paid.
