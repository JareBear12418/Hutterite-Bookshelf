Jesus is walking beside me
Guiding each step of the way
Safely He'll lead me to heaven
Gladly His voice I obey.

CHORUS

He lovingly guards every footstep
He tenderly cares for me
His strong arms of love are about me
My Savior and Shepherd is He.

He knows each turn of the pathway
He is a light for my feet
He has the power to keep me
Though many dangers we meet.

He knows my weakness and failures
And should I linger behind
Patient is He and forgiving
So understanding and kind.
