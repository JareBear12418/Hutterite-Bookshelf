I have made a lot of friends in my lifetime
And I've come to appreciate them all
But I've found one friend who is closer than a brother
He's my best friend, and He's the precious Son of God.

CHORUS

His name is Jesus, His name is Jesus
What a privilege to know the Son of God
He lives inside of me, and He walks beside me
He's my best friend, and He's the precious Son of God.

There's a lot of folks I like to spend some time with
Just to be around and get to know them a little more
But I've got one friend that I find the most refreshing
It's spending time with Jesus Christ my Lord.
