Every morning mercies new
Fall as fresh as morning dew
Every morning let us pay
Tribute with the early day
For Thy mercies Lord are sure
Thy compassion doth endure.

Still the greatness ofThy love
Daily doth our sins renew
Daily far as east from west
Lifts the burden from the breast
Gives unbought to those who pray
Strength to stand in evil day.

Let our prayers each morn prevail
That these gifts may never fail
And as we confess the sin
And the tempters pow'r within
Feed us with the Bread of Life
Fit us for our daily strife.

As the morning light returns
As the sun with splendor burns
Teach us still to turn to Thee
Ever blessed Trinity
With our hands our hearts to raise
In unfailing prayer and praise.
