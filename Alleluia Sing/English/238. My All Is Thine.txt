I saw a wounded robin lie with broken wing upon the ground
My heart was filled with deep compassion for its need
And I could tell by fearful eye it was not glad it had been found
And by its fluttering showed that it distrusted me.

I bent and reached an outstretched hand to lift it away
And nurse it back to health again as it had been another day
It struggled wildly in my grasp for just one moment to be sure
It now lay gasping from the pain it must endure.

Dear Lord I pray how iike this bird when sorely stricken and forlorn
When faith has faltered and I can not see the way
Have I drawn back and failed to claim Thy tender love and healing power
O Lord I find it hard to live that lonely hour.

Forgive me Lord for all the days when I refused Thy chastening hand
Thy ways are infinitely great and sometimes hard to understand
Remove my fears and darkest trust and fill my soul with love divine
My every thought and heart and love shall all be Thine.
