As I wake up with the morning of each day that passes by
And I listen to the sounds upon my ear
I can't help but keep a watch toward the eastern sky
And I wonder if the trumpet will be the next sound that I hear.

CHORUS

What a beautiful day for the Lord to come again
What a beautiful day for Him to call His children home
Oh, how I long to see His face and to touch His blessed hand
What a beautiful day for the Lord to come again.

All my earthly disappointments and my trials here below
Fade away when I remember His last words
He said He'd return and receive His children unto Him
And I'm longing to look upon the face of my Lord.
