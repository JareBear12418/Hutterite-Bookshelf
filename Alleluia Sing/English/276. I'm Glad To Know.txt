Christ was crucified and for me He died
So from sin's bondage I could be free
Then He rose again, He's at the Fathers' right hand
Interceding for my every need.

CHORUS

I'm glad to know that I know Jesus
I am His and He is mine
And it gives me peace of mind
Just to know He'll be waiting for me
When I cross chilly Jordan someday.

There was a time when I did not know Him
And my life was burdened with sin
Then we met one day at on old-fashioned altar
And now He is my dearest friend.
