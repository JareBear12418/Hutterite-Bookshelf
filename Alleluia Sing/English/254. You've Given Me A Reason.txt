My life was so empty, so dark and lonely
I needed a lifeline to reach out and save me
Then You came, oh Lord, and You gave me this feeling
You've given me a reason to start believing.

CHORUS

You've given me a reason to start believing
You've given me the courage to face my worries
You've taken my prayers and You gave me a vision
You've given me a reason to start believing.

You gave Your life on the tree at Calvary
You suffered my shame and agony
Now I know that You'll never leave me
You've given me a reason to start believing.

BRIDGE

You've gone to heaven but Your spirit's still here
I can feel Your presence, You're always near.
