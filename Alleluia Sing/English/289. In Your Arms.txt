When the sea is raging and waves are crashing round
When my heart is heavy and I'm swiftly going down
Help me to remember, however rough the sea
That underneath the current Your arms are holding me.

CHORUS

In Your arms You cradle me and make me feel secure
In Your arms You're showing me Your mercy will endure
In Your arms You're lifting me above the troubled sea
I'll be safe because I know Your arms are holding me.

When the storm has ceased her raging, the sun will still remain
So until the shadows vanish, Your power will sustain
Oh it's there that I find refuge, where I'll be safe from harm
No storm can overtake me in the shelter of Your arm.
