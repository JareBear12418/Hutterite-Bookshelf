To Canaan's land I'm on my way
Where the soul (of man) never dies
Our darkest night will turn to day
Where the soul (of man) never dies.

CHORUS

No sad farewells (Dear friends there'll be no sad farewells)
No tear-dimmed eyes (There'll be no tear dimmed eyes)
Where all is love (Where all is peace and joy and love)
And the soul (of man) never dies.

A rose is blooming there for me
Where the soul (of man) never dies
Where I will spend eternity
Where the soul (of man) never dies.

A love-light beams across the foam
Where the soul (of man) never dies
It shines to light the shores of home
Where the soul (of man) never dies.

My life will end in deathless sleep
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And everlasting joys I'll reap
Where the soul (of man) never dies.

I'm on my way to that fair land
Where the soul (of man) never dies
Where there will be no parting hand
Where the soul (of man) never dies.
