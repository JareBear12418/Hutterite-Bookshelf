There is a Redeemer
Jesus, God's own Son
Precious lamb of God Messiah
Holy One.

CHORUS

Thank You oh my Father
For giving us Your Son
And leaving Your Spirit
Till the work on Earth is done.

Jesus my Redeemer
Name above all names
Precious lamb of God, Messiah
Oh, for sinners slain.

When I stand in Glory
I will see His face
And there I'll serve my King forever
In that Holy Place.
