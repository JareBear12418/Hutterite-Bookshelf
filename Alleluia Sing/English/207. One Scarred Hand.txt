He is the fountain for a thirsty soul
He is a healer and so much more
When my heart is broken by the world's demands
The pieces are mended with one scarred hand.

CHORUS

And when I can't stand, I have to lean
And when I can't see, I must believe
The great Physician's touch is a balm that can
Mend a broken heart with one scarred hand.

It's the hand that hung this old world in place
Oh, the hand that was scarred just to give me grace
And to think that a hand that holds the stars
Is small enough to mend one broken heart.
