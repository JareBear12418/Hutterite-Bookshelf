Life is a gift that we all must lay down
Whether we be rich or poor
And Jesus is willing to give us a crown
And fill us with love that is pure.

CHORUS

Jesus is whispering, whispering now
Why will you wait, why will you wait
Jesus is whispering, whispering now
listen to His voice, don't turn Him away.

If life seems so hard and seems useless to live
With trials and troubles to face
Just ask God to comfort, He's willing and will
With gladness and love take His place.

Willing to bow in the presence of God
Striving to win the reward
Wandering home on this path that I trod
Willing to work for the lost.
