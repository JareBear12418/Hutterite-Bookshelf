Holy Spirit, carry me
To higher plains of liberty
I want to be so close to Thee
That through my life the world can see
Help me when I'm feeling low
And burdens seem so hard to bear
Lift me up, don't let me go
It's so good to know You're there.

CHORUS

Holy Spirit lead me on
Give me strength when things go wrong
I won't ask for much at all
Just pick me up when I fall.

When have I to fear or dread
If by His Spirit I am led
I'll try not to plan ahead
Gonna wait for leadership instead
Like the potter and the clay
Form my life to fit Your plan
Give me joy each passing day
And help me love my fellowman.
