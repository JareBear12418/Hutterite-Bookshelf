In a vine-covered shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting the battle of time
There's a dear one who's weathered life's sorrow
It's that silver-haired daddy of mine.

CHORUS

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old Daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver-haired daddy of mine.

I know it's too late, dear old Daddy
To repay for the heartaches and care
But dear Mother is waiting in heaven
Just to comfort and solace you there.
