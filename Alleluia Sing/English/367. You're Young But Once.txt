You're young but once
Are you living in the truth
Are you living right, are you in the fight
Of right against the wrong
Are you hoping now, someway, somehow
Your future will be bright
Whate'er you sow is what will grow
You'll reap whate'er you sow.

CHORUS

You're only young (only young, only young)
But once (you're only young but once)
Then live each day (live each day, live it)
For the Lord (for the Lord, for the Lord)
Embrace the truth while in your youth
Be faithful, brave, be true
Overcome the wrong, you can be strong
Through Christ who strengthens you.

You're young but once
Live a life that's full and free
Are you seeing right, are you in the light
The sunshine warm and true
There's no better way, oh happy day
Live each day for the Lord
Whate'er you sow is what will grow
You'll reap whate'er you sow.

You're young but once
Would you like a happy home
Of your very own, where the light of love
Is shining from above
As you lived your youth, this living truth
Your children follow you
Whate'er you sow is what will grow
You'll reap whate'er you sow.
