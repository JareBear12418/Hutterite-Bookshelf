There are those who think that love comes with a lifetime guarantee
But we know from those around us, that this may not always be
It's the simple things that come between a father and a son
But when they try to talk, the lights are out before they have begun.

Well, that was me, and I have seen
The light that shines for eternity
Because I learned to say the words 'I love you.'

So many hearts have been broken by the lies of history
And so many arms are still open for that final mystery
We must show respect for all the rest, and what a man believes
And the One who died upon the cross, well, He is the One for me.

And He said 'Come with Me and you will see
The light that shines for eternity
Be strong and learn to say the words 'I love you.'

And this endless road that we are on just keeps on going 'round
But there's one destination that always is here to be found.

So come with me, and you will see
The light that shines for eternity
Be strong and learn to say the words 'I love you'
Be strong enough to say the words 'I love you'.
