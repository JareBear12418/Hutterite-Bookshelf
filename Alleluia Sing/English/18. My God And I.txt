My God and I go in the fields together
We walk and talk as good friends should and do
:We clasp our hands, our voices ring with laughter
My God and I walk through the meadows hue:

He tells me of the years that went before me
When heavenly plans for me were made to be
:Then all was but a dream of dim conception
To come to life, earth's verdant glory see:

My God and I will go for aye together
We'll walk and talk as good friends should and do
:This earth will pass and with it common trifle
But God and I will go unendingly'
