Just suppose God searched through the heavens
And couldn't find one willing to be
The supreme sacrifice that was needed
To provide eternal life for you and me.

CHORUS

Oh, had it not been for a place called Mount Calvary
Had it not been for the old rugged cross
Had it not been for a man called Jesus
Then forever my soul would be lost.

I'm so glad He was willing to drink His bitter cup
Although He prayed, 'Father let it pass from Me'
Oh I'm so glad He didn't call to heaven's angels
To pull those nails from His hands tormenting Him.
