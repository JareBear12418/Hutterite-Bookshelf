We never know when shadows fall if another day will dawn
Nor if the plans that we have made will turn out right or wrong
We only know that Jesus' love will go on endlessly
While others round about us fall, at peace in Christ we'll be.

CHORUS

So live one day at a time (so live one day at a time)
Be thoughtful, loving and kind (be thoughtful, loving and kind)
Just do your best and leave God the rest
And live one day at a time (and live one day at a time).

Don't build your mansions here on earth, nor gather precious stones
Forget those things that have no worth in an eternal home
For life is so uncertain friend, and death is ever near
So lay up treasures in the sky, insure your presence there.

The beauty of this life seems drear, when seen in Heaven's light
There is a home prepared by God for Christians living right
Why hold to pleasures of this world that fade in just a day
When loving Him who gave us life is now the only way?'
