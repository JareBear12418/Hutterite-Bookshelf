'Twas a day in early springtime by an ancient wayside well
Eleazar paused to rest his camel train
He had found a bride for Isaac as the evening shadows fell
For his weary journey had not been in vain.

Now he took the fair Rebecca draped in jewels rich and rare
Back to Abraham and Isaac far away
Where Rebecca loved her Isaac and he loved Rebecca fair
Oh that must have been a happy wedding day.

CHORUS

Oh, get ready, the evening shadows fall
Can't you hear the Eleazar call
For there's going to be a wedding
Our joy will soon begin
In the evening when the camel train comes in.

Now the blessed Holy Spirit left the Father God above
To come down to earth to find a worthy Bride
For our Isaac over yonder has prepared His tents of love
And He wants his fair Rebecca by His side.

We have left our kinfolk gladly we have bid this world goodbye
We are going to a land beyond the sky
Where we'll behold our Isaac in that blest eternity
What a happy, happy wedding that will be.
