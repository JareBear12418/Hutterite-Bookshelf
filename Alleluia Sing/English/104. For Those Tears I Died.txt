You said You'd come and share all my sorrows
You said You'd be there for all my tomorrows
I came so close to sending You away
But just like You promised, You came here to stay
I just had to pray.

CHORUS

And Jesus said, 'Come to the water, stand by My side
I know you are thirsty, you won't be denied
I felt every teardrop when in darkness you cried
And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died.'

Your goodness so great, I can't understand
And dear Lord, I know that all this was planned
I know You're here now and always will be
Your love loosed my chains and in You I am free
But Jesus, why me?

Jesus I give You my heart and my soul
I know without God I'd never be whole
Savior You've opened all the right doors
And I thank You and praise You from earth's humble shores
Take me, I'm Yours.
