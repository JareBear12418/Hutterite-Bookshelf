Low in the grave He lay
Jesus my Savior
Waiting the coming day
Jesus my Lord.

CHORUS

Up from the grave He arose (He arose)
With a mighty triumph o'er His foes (He arose)
He arose a victor from the dark domain
And He lives forever with His saints to reign
He arose (He arose), He arose (He arose)
Hallelujah, Christ arose.

Vainly they watch His bed
Jesus my Savior
Vainly they seal the dead
Jesus my Lord.

Death cannot keep his prey
Jesus my Savior
He tore the bars away
Jesus my Lord.
