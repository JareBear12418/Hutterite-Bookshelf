Lord I care not for riches neither silver nor gold
I would make sure of heaven, I would enter the fold
In the book ofThy kingdom with its pages so fair
Tell me Jesus my Savior, is my name written there?

CHORUS

Is my name written there
On the page white and fair
In the book of Thy kingdom
Is my name written there?

Lord my sins they are many like the sands of the sea
But Thy blood, oh my Savior, is sufficient for me
For Thy promise is written in bright letters that glow
'Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them as snow.'

Oh, that beautiful city with its mansions of light
With its glorified beings in pure garments of white
Where no evil thing cometh to despoil what is fair
Where the angels are waiting, yes, my name's written there'
