Am I a soldier of the cross
A follower of the lamb
And shall I fear to own His cause
Or blush to speak His name.

Must I be carried to the sky
On flowery beds of ease
While others fought to win the prize
And sail through bloody seas.

Are there no foes for me to face
Must I not stem the flood
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God?

Sure I must fight, if I would reign
Increase my courage, Lord
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain
Supported by Thy Word.

Thy saints in all this glorious war
Shall conquer, though they die
They view the triumph from afar
And seize it with their eye.

When that illustrious day shall rise
And all Thy armies shine
In robes of vict'ry through the skies
The glory shall be Thine.
