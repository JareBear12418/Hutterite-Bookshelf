Have you read the story of the cross
Where Jesus bled and died
Where your debt was paid by His precious blood
That flowed from His wounded side.

CHORUS

He died of a broken heart for thee
He died of a broken heart
Oh wondrous love, it was for thee
He died of a broken heart.

Have you read how they placed a crown of thorns
Upon His lovely brows
When He prayed 'Forgive them, oh forgive
They know not what they do.'

Have you read that He saved the dying thief
While hanging on the tree
Who looked with pitying eyes and said
'Dear Lord, remember me'.

Have you read that He looked to Heaven and said
'Tis finished, 'twas for thee'
Have you ever said, 'I thank Thee Lord
For giving Thy life for me'.
