Jesus, how sweet is Your name to my ear
Since I've found Him I've not been the same
Truly His love drives away every fear
And oh, there is pow'r in His name.

CHORUS

No other name, no other name
Only Jesus salvation can give
And only through Him can we enter the fold
Changed and made worthy to live.

Jesus, the giver of everything good
He knoweth the need of a man
He healeth my soul, for He said that He would
And oh, there is pow'r in His name.
