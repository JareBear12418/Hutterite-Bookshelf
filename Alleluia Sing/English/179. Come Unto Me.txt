Hear the blessed Savior calling the oppressed
Oh ye heavy laden come to Me and rest
Come, no longer tarry, I your load will bear
Bring Me every burden, bring Me every care.

CHORUS

Come unto Me (come unto Me)
I will give you rest (I will give you rest)
Take My yoke upon you (take My yoke upon you)
Hear Me and be blessed (hear Me and be blessed)
I am meek and lowly (I am meek and lowly)
Come and trust My might (come and trust My might)
Come, My yoke is easy, and My burden light (and My burden light).

Have you cares of business, cares of passing debt
Cares of social life or cares of hope unmet
Are you by remorse or sense of guilt depressed
Come right on to Jesus, He will give you rest.

Have you in temptations often conquered been
Has a sense of weakness brought distress within
Christ will sanctify you if you claim His best
In the Holy Spirit He will give you rest.
