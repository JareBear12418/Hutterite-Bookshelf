Just lean upon the arms of Jesus
He'll help you along, help you along
If you will trust His love unfailing
He'll fill your heart with song.

CHORUS

Lean on His arms (lean on His arms, fully-)
Trusting in His love
Lean on His arms (lean upon His arms and-)
All His mercies prove
Lean on His arms (lean on his arms, ever-)
Looking home above
Just lean on the Savior's arms.

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus
He'll brighten the way, brighten the way
Just follow gladly where He leadeth
His gentle voice obey.

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus
Oh bring every care, bring every care
The burden that has seemed so heavy
Take to the Lord in prayer.

Just lean upon the arms of Jesus
Then leave all to Him, leave all to Him
His heart is full of love and mercy
His eyes are never dim.
