The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide
A shelter in the time of storm
Secure whatever ill betide
A shelter in the time of storm.

CHORUS

Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land
A weary land, a weary land
Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shade by day, defense by night
A shelter in the time of storm
No fears alarm, no foes affright
A shelter in the time of storm.

The raging storms may round us beat
A shelter in the time of storm
We'll never leave our safe retreat
A shelter in the time of storm.

Oh Rock divine, oh Refuge dear
A shelter in the time of storm
Be Thou our helper ever near
A shelter in the time of storm. '
