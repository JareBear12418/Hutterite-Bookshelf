When burdens come so hard to bear
That no earthly friend can share
Tears drive away the smiles and leave my heart in pain
Then my Lord from Heaven above
Speaks to me in tones of love
Wipes away the tears and makes me smile again.

CHORUS

I need no mansion here below
For Jesus said that I could go
To a home beyond the skies not made by hand
Won't you come and go along
We will sing the sweetest song
Ever played upon the harps in Gloryland.

Oh the thought to me is sweet
That my loved ones I will meet
At the ending of the journey here below
Seems I'li hear their voices blend
In a world without an end
I won't worry when the time shall come to go.

When Jesus comes to claim His own
I will move to my new home
I'll walk and talk with Him upon the streets of gold
A mansion there is waiting me
Soon its beauty I shall see
In that city where we never shall grow old.
