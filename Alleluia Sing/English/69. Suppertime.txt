When I was but a boy in days of childhood
I used to play till evening shadows fall
Then winding down an old familiar pathway
I heard my mother call at set of sun:

CHORUS

Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last.

One day beside her bedside I was kneeling
And angel's wings were hovering in the air
She heard the call for suppertime in Heaven
And now I know she's waiting for me there.

In visions now I see her standing yonder
And her familiar voice I hear once more
The banquet table's ready up in heaven
It's suppertime upon the golden shore'
