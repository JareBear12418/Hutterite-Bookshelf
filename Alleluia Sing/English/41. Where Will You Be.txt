Just one life to live on earth and it quickly passes by
From the moment of our birth till the time has come to die
God has given us this choice to decide our destiny
In a million years, where will you be?

CHORUS

Where will you be a million years from now
Will you be happy, will you be singing
While ages roll throughout eternity
I ask this question, where will you be?

In the Bible we are told of the day that soon will come
When the people of the earth shall be gathered 'round God's throne
And to stand before the King there for all the world to see
In a million years, where will you be?'
