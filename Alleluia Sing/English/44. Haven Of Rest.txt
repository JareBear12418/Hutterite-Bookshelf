My soul in sad exile was out on life's sea
So burdened with sin and distress
Till I heard the sweet voice saying, make me your choice
And I entered the haven of rest.

CHORUS

I've anchored my soul in the haven of rest
I'll sail the white seas no more
The tempest may sweep o'er the wild stormy deep
In Jesus I'm safe ever more.

I yielded myself to His tender embrace
And faith taking hold of the Word
My fetters fell off and I anchored my soul
The haven of rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul since the Lord made me whole
Has been the old story of the blessed
Of Jesus Who'll save whosoever will have
A home in the haven of rest.

Oh come to the Savior, He patiently waits
To save by His power divine
Come anchor your soul in the haven of rest
And say my Beloved is mine.
